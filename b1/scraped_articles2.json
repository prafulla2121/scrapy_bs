    "body": "Since assuming office, the Trump administration has intensified efforts to curb illegal immigration in the United States. As part of these measures, authorities have introduced a new mobile application called &lsquo;CBP Home&rsquo; has been introduced to facilitate voluntary departures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the CBP Home app?&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed by the US Department of Homeland Security, the CBP Home App provides a system for undocumented immigrants to indicate their willingness to leave the country voluntarily. The initiative is designed to encourage what officials term &lsquo;self-deportation&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The app aligns with the Trump administration&rsquo;s broader strategy to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants in the country. It is being promoted as a &ldquo;convenient and cost-effective&rdquo; tool to support ongoing deportation efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a post on X, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said, &ldquo;The Biden administration exploited the CBP One app to allow more than 1 million aliens to illegally enter the United States. With the launch of the CBP Home App, we are restoring integrity to our immigration system.&rdquo;&nbsp;Noem further said, &ldquo;The CBP Home app gives aliens the option to leave now and self-deport, so they may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream. If they don&rsquo;t, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return.&rdquo;&nbsp;How does the CBP Home app work?&nbsp;&nbsp;The app is available for free download on mobile devices. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), &ldquo;Aliens (illegal immigrants) should use the CBP Home mobile phone application to submit their intent to depart.&rdquo;&nbsp;Users can navigate to the &lsquo;Submit Intent to Depart&rsquo; section within the app and follow the instructions to initiate the self-deportation process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who all can use the app?&nbsp;&nbsp;The app is intended for individuals residing in the US without legal status. One of the first reported users was Rajani Srinivasan, a Columbia University student whose visa was revoked due to accusations of &lsquo;advocating for violence and terrorism&rsquo;.&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s take on CBP Home&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking about the initiative, Donald Trump issued a strong warning to those who choose not to use the app for voluntary departure. &ldquo;My administration is launching the CBP Home app to give people in our country illegally an easy way to leave now and self-deport voluntarily,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trump also emphasised the consequences of ignoring this option. &ldquo;If they do, they could potentially have the opportunity to return legally at some point in the future. But if they do not avail themselves of this opportunity, then they will be found, they will be deported, and they will never be admitted again to the United States ever, ever again. You&#39;re never coming in.&rdquo;&nbsp;He also described the CBP Home app as the &ldquo;safest option for illegal aliens&rdquo; to leave the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "title": "Market slowdown explained: Debt funds outperform equity after 2 years",
    "body": "Debt funds have begun outperforming equity funds for the first time since May 2023, marking the end of a two-year trend This trend reversal, noted by analysts at Elara Capital, suggests that equity markets may be entering a period of prolonged weakness. The performance of debt funds has been a key indicator of this shift, signaling potential headwinds for equity markets in the coming months.&nbsp;For the first time since 2011, debt funds are seeing a 1-year rolling period outperform equity funds, and the underperformance of equity funds in February 2025, which reached 4.7%, marks the largest gap since 2018. Historically, such periods of underperformance in equity funds have been followed by multiple rounds of correction in the stock market, suggesting that a similar phase may be underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding to the concern is a growing trend of underperformance in active funds compared to passive funds. Active strategies, which typically involve more flexibility and active management, have struggled to keep pace with the more stable and predictable passive funds. This marks the first significant instance of active funds underperforming since 2023, with earlier periods of similar performance seen in 2011-2014 and 2018-2020. During those phases, large-cap stocks, especially those within the Nifty Top-10, led the market&#39;s outperformance. This trend could be another indicator of a weakening equity environment.&nbsp;Shift Back to Larger Names and Weaker Market Breadth&nbsp;&nbsp;Further signs of a deteriorating equity environment are emerging with the shift in index weights back to larger names in the market. The weight of the top 50 stocks in the NSE500 index has been steadily increasing since May 2020, indicating a growing preference for larger companies over smaller ones. This trend of market polarization is often a leading indicator of weak economic or earnings growth ahead. Historically, such phases of market polarization have been accompanied by weak market breadth and sideways or correcting markets, which signals that investors may want to reallocate funds towards large-cap stocks to avoid further underperformance.&nbsp;This shift is reminiscent of previous market downturns, including those seen in 2008-2009, 2010-2013, and 2018-2020, when smaller companies underperformed, and liquidity in mid and small-cap stocks faded. As this trend continues, it suggests that investors should be cautious about smaller-cap stocks, which could face additional pressure as liquidity dries up.&nbsp;Addition of new folios&ndash; Smallcap folio addition rate drops to 2-year low. Midcap & Thematic also plunge&nbsp;Rate of new folio addition in Mutual funds gives an indication of the breadth of Retail participation. While flows will be influenced by the size of the investor, new folio addition will be a better reflection of breadth of investor participation.&nbsp;&quot;In Feb&rsquo;25, Equity funds saw addition of 1.8 million folios, which is the slowest monthly addition since November 2023. This was largely on back of slowest folio addition in Midcap, Smallcap and Thematic/Sectoral funds. What is more concerning is that bulk of new investors in Midcap and Thematic/Sectoral funds came into markets post election results of June 2024. And a meaningful portion of these investors are already sitting on losses. Although, we have still not seen much impact on flows, these could be initial leads of flows turning weak going ahead,&quot; said Sunil Jain of Elara Capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;What this means: Of concern is the fact that many of the new investors in mid-cap and thematic funds entered the market after the June 2024 election results and are now sitting on losses, indicating that investor sentiment may be weakening.&nbsp; Cash levels surge: &nbsp; Another worrying sign for equity markets is the sharp increase in cash levels held by fund managers, particularly in mid-cap and small-cap funds. Cash levels in large-cap schemes have expanded to 4.8%, the highest since June 2023, while mid-cap and small-cap funds have seen similar increases. The total cash held across all active equity schemes now stands at Rs1.74 trillion ($20 billion). Rising cash levels as a percentage of free-float market cap reflect a lack of conviction among fund managers, potentially due to fears of further market declines and a slowdown in retail flows.Changes in Mutual Fund Allocation and increased focus on large caps &nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual fund allocations change &nbsp; In line with these developments, mutual fund allocation is also starting to shift, particularly in the Flexicap schemes, which allow more flexibility in investing across market caps. These schemes have seen a slight reduction in their allocation to small-cap stocks, now holding 10.5% of their assets in small caps, down from 12% in October 2024. This is a significant trend as Flexicap funds are typically seen as a bellwether for investor sentiment. As the allocation to small-cap stocks decreases, the focus is shifting more toward large-cap stocks, suggesting that fund managers are preparing for continued market uncertainty.&nbsp;Signs of Domestic Panic in the Market&nbsp;Finally, one of the most telling indicators of potential market instability is the rising percentage of equity schemes hitting their 52-week lows. Historically, such spikes have been an early sign of a larger market downtrend. In March 2025, the percentage of equity schemes hitting their 52-week lows surged to 45%, signaling an initial panic among investors. Previous cycles, such as in 2008, 2011, and 2018, saw similar spikes followed by more significant corrections. If this trend continues, the market may experience a deeper sell-off in the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "body": "Whatever domestic economic gain comes from US President Donald Trump&#39;s new 25 per cent tax on imported cars and experts are skeptical automakers around the world are bracing for a lot of pain.In Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Canada and across Europe, the world&#39;s largest automakers employ millions of people whose livelihoods depend on US car buyers, who currently spend more than $240 billion annually on imported cars and light trucks.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;European automakers decry Trump&#39;s auto tariffs that will &#39;punish consumers&#39;The Trump tariffs aimed at boosting US jobs and tax revenues will also affect imported auto parts, which were valued at $197 billion last year.The impact will be really huge and very disruptive, said Sigrid de Vries, director general of the European Automobile Manufacturers&#39; Association.Vries and others critics say American car shoppers will also be worse off, as tariffs push prices higher.Policymakers around the world said on Thursday they were weighing their next moves namely, whether to retaliate, and if so, how.But they also expressed hope that negotiations with Washington could avert an escalating trade war, and the economic damage and global supply chain disruptions that would come with it.Trump said the tariffs on autos would start being collected on April 3.The impending hit comes on top of other US tariffs planned globally on steel and aluminum, and at a time when competition from China, and the transition to electric vehicles, is already pressuring automakers.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Auto street set for rough ride as Donald Trump tariffs spark worriesThe anticipated blow knocked down the stock prices of many major automakers on Thursday, including Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Kia and BMW.US carmakers are less exposed to possible retaliation because they export only 2 per cent of their production to the EU. Still, shares of Ford and General Motors fell because the US industry relies heavily on cross-border trade in auto parts although Tesla is an exception and its stock price rose on Thursday.Most foreign carmakers have plants in the US -- Japanese carmakers have two dozen, for example -- but that would not shield them if they use imported parts, unless those parts are exempted under a free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.The auto tariffs will be felt sharply in Europe, for whom the US is the biggest export market for an industry that supports nearly 14 million jobs.The EU&#39;s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, has travelled to Washington at least twice since Trump was reelected to try to engage the administration. But Trump says the tariffs, which his administration estimates would raise USD 100 billion in revenue annually, are permanent. The White House has claimed they will foster domestic manufacturing.The head of the United Auto Workers, Shawn Fain, thanked the White House for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades.The US president on Monday cited plans by South Korean automaker Hyundai to build a USD 5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana as evidence that tariffs would bring back manufacturing jobs.Economists say the tariffs will only raise costs that will be passed on to consumers and lead to a cycle of retaliation that will reduce trade between countries.There&#39;s a risk of retaliatory tariffs and then a tit-for-tat, and then we end up with significant barriers to trade and we all lose out, said David Bailey, professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham. That&#39;s the fundamental problem here, essentially that governments will start to retaliate against each other.Before the new auto tariffs were announced, the EU had been planning to re-impose suspended tariffs in mid-April on a range of US goods, including jeans, bourbon and motorcycles, as part of a previous dispute over trade in steel and aluminum.We have our plans ready,&quot; said EU foreign affairs representative Kaja Kallas.But she said there is still uncertainty about which tariffs Trump will follow through on, and which can be resolved through negotiations.Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Thursday reiterated a request that his country&#39;s automakers be exempted from Trump&#39;s tariffs. When asked about possible responses, he said all options are on the table, without giving specifics.The union that represents auto workers in Canada lashed out at Trump&#39;s decision, and called on their prime minister, Mark Carney, to retaliate if necessary.We have never seen an attack like this but we are ready, said Lana Payne, the national president of Unifor.She said Carney should tell Trump that if US automakers are going to sell cars and trucks in Canada they are going to have to build in Canada.Autos are Canada&#39;s second largest export, and on Wednesday before Trump made his announcement Carney unveiled a USD 1.4 billion strategic response fund that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by the tariffs.For now, international auto companies are reluctant to make expensive operational changes, such as adjusting supply chains or relocating more production to the US, since it is still possible the tariffs will be withdrawn by Trump if they cause too much economic pain for Americans, according to analysts at the Sanford C Bernstein research firm.Despite claims that the tariffs would last for Trump&#39;s full term, we think it is unlikely that the new tariff regime will last, given the wide-spread damage they will do across industries and the inflationary impact on the US economy, they wrote.",

It&#39;s unusual for a US president and Canadian prime minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office.Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as Canada&#39;s leader and the head of the Liberal Party, is at the start of a five-week campaign after calling an early election for April 28.The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war and challenged Canada&#39;s sovereignty. The crisis has created a surge in patriotism among Canadians, with many in the country feeling that Carney is the best person to lead Canada at the moment.Trump has acknowledged himself that he has upended Canadian politics.Carney has called the tariffs unjustified and left the election campaign to chair his special Cabinet committee on US relations in Ottawa.Automobiles are Canada&#39;s second-largest export and the sector employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.Trump previously had granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on auto imports from Mexico and Canada for US automakers.In the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-US border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan.Trump previously placed 25 per cent tariffs on Canada&#39;s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products -- as well as on all of America&#39;s trading partners -- on April 2.",

    "title": "Proposed European force for Ukraine may respond if Russia attacks: Macron",
    "body": "French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday that a proposed European armed force for possible deployment in Ukraine in tandem with an eventual peace deal could respond to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one.Macron spoke after talks with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and ahead of a summit in Paris of some 30 nations on Thursday that will discuss the proposed force for Ukraine.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;White House announces Black Sea ceasefire between Russia and UkraineIf there was again a generalised aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would be under attack and then it&#39;s our usual framework of engagement. Our soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it, Macron said.Their collective name, coalition of the willing, suggests that the loose grouping of Ukraine&#39;s allies certainly wants to help. But as the nearly three dozen nations gather again for more talks in Paris, it is still far from clear exactly what kind of aid they are preparing that could contribute toward their goal of making any ceasefire with Russia lasting.Macron, who has been driving the coalition-building effort with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is expecting 31 delegations around the table on Thursday morning at the presidential Elysee Palace. That&#39;s more than Macron gathered for a first meeting in Paris in February evidence that the coalition to help Ukraine, possibly with boots on the ground, is gathering steam, according to the presidential office.The big elephant in the room will be the country that&#39;s missing the United States.US President Donald Trump&#39;s administration has shown no public enthusiasm for the coalition&#39;s discussions about potentially sending troops into Ukraine after an eventual ceasefire to help make peace stick. Trump&#39;s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has dismissed the idea of a European deployment or even the need for it.It&#39;s a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic, he said in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.That&#39;s not the view in Europe.The shared premise upon which the coalition is being built is that Russian President Vladimir Putin&#39;s actions in Ukraine starting with the illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and culminating in the 2022 full-scale invasion that unleashed all-out war shows that he cannot be trusted.They believe that any peace deal will need to be backed up by security guarantees for Ukraine, to deter Putin from launching another attempt to seize it.European officials say that in any peace-deal scenario, Ukraine&#39;s first line of defence against any future Russian aggression would be Ukraine&#39;s own army.Options for the coalition of allies could include providing more military training to help replenish the Ukrainian army&#39;s losses, which Kyiv keeps secret but are heavy after more than three years of intense fighting.That&#39;s something allies already have been doing, preparing more than 75,000 Ukrainian troops for battle against Russia&#39;s larger and expanding military.The 27-nation European Union is also pressing ahead with a so-called steel porcupine strategy aimed at making Ukraine an even tougher nut for Russia to crack, by strengthening its armed forces and defense industry.Britain is also pledging continued military aid so Ukraine can keep fighting if peace talks fail or a ceasefire is broken.",

    "title": "Zelenskyy calls on US to sanction Russia after fresh drone strikes",
    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the United States on Wednesday to further sanction Moscow, which he said was clearly not pursuing a &quot;real peace&quot; after a night of Russian drone attacks that caused damage in several places.&nbsp;He singled out strikes on his hometown of Kryvyi Rih and the northern region of Sumy, as questions swirled over basic details of two ceasefire agreements that were announced by the United States on Tuesday after talks in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;The United States said it agreed to separate deals with Ukraine and Russia to pause their strikes over the Black Sea and against each other&#39;s energy targets, although it was unclear when the agreements came into force.&nbsp;President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said they were effective immediately, but the Kremlin said the Black Sea agreements would not come into effect unless some Russian banks were linked back up with the international financial system. The Kremlin says it is already implementing its pause on energy attacks.&nbsp;None of the Ukrainian statements said Russia attacked energy infrastructure overnight, but Zelenskyy said they went against the spirit of the peace talks.&nbsp;&quot;Launching such large-scale attacks after ceasefire negotiations is a clear signal to the whole world that Moscow is not going to pursue real peace,&quot; Zelenskyy wrote on X.&nbsp;Russia, which only reports the destruction of drones, said it had destroyed nine drones, including two over the Black Sea.Moscow said Ukraine had tried to attack a gas storage facility in Russian-occupied Crimea and energy infrastructure in Russia&#39;s Kursk and Bryansk regions. It did not report any damage.&nbsp;There was no immediate response from Kyiv. The Ukrainian military reported 117 drone attacks and local officials said the city of Kryvyi Rih had been hit by the biggest drone attack it has faced since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion in 2022.&nbsp;&quot;Apparently, this is how the occupiers &#39;want peace&#39;,&quot; Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the military administration, wrote on the Telegram messaging app, saying the attack sparked fires and damaged buildings.&nbsp;He said there were at least 15 explosions in the city, which has been regularly attacked throughout the war.&quot;Most importantly, there were no deaths or injuries.&quot;&nbsp;Nightly Russian drone attacks have been a feature of life in Ukrainian cities for many months. So have power outages as missiles have hammered the power grid, although Russian attacks have targeted gas facilities more recently. Kyiv has used drones to hit Russian oil facilities to strike back at its larger foe.&nbsp;Zelenskyy said: &quot;Everyone who was affected must be given assistance. But there must also be clear pressure and strong action from the world on Russia &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; more pressure, more sanctions from the United States to stop Russian strikes.&quot; Seven Russian drones were shot down over the southern region of Mykolaiv, home to its eponymous port which provides access to the Black Sea and which has been closed since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion, the governor said.&nbsp;In the city of Okhtyrka in the border region of Sumy, the local governor said a drone attack damaged two apartment buildings, an administrative building, four shops, 14 market stands and other non-residential buildings.&nbsp;The city of Mykolaiv faced emergency power outages early on Wednesday, the mayor said, though he did not say if the measure was precautionary or if it had been caused by the attacks.&nbsp;Trolleybuses briefly stopped working normally, officials said. Reuters could not independently verify the reports from Kryvyi Rih and the regions of Mykolaiv and Sumy. What was targeted there was not immediately clear.&nbsp;In total, the Ukrainian military said its air defence units had shot down 56 of the 117 drones it reported overnight. It said 48 more of those drones had been &quot;lost&quot;, shorthand that usually means they were suppressed by electronic warfare defences. There was no immediate comment from Russia.",

    "body": "The Supreme Court on Thursday remarked that the notion of family in India seems to be eroding with society moving towards a &ldquo;one person, one family&rdquo; model.&nbsp;A bench comprising Justices Pankaj Mithal and SVN Bhatti made the observation while hearing a plea filed by 68-year-old Samtola Devi seeking the eviction of her eldest son, Krishna Kumar, from their family home in Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh.&nbsp;The top court also remarked that while the nation upholds the philosophy of &lsquo;Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam&rsquo; &ndash; the belief that the world is one family &ndash; this principle is increasingly difficult to uphold even within immediate families today.&nbsp;Also Read: Latest LIVE NewsCase background: Family property disputeThe case revolved around a long-standing property dispute between Samtola Devi, her deceased husband Kallu Mal, and their eldest son Krishna Kumar. The couple owned a house with three shops and had three sons and two daughters. However, family disputes emerged, particularly with Krishna Kumar, who took over the family business. The dispute has been ongoing since 2014.&nbsp;In 2014, Kallu Mal made an application to the SDM, Sadar of District Sultanpur accusing Krishna Kumar of abuse and sought legal intervention.&nbsp;In 2017, the couple approached a family court for maintenance, which was granted at ₹8,000 per month, to be shared equally between Krishna Kumar and another son, Janardan.&nbsp;In 2019, the parents moved for Krishna Kumar&rsquo;s eviction under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act. While the maintenance tribunal restricted Krishna Kumar from encroaching on the house without parental permission, it did not order eviction.&nbsp;The parents appealed, and the appellate tribunal ruled in favour of eviction, but the High Court later reversed this decision. After Kallu Mal&rsquo;s death, Samtola Devi continued the legal battle, eventually approaching the Supreme Court.&nbsp;No legal ground for eviction: Supreme CourtThe Supreme Court upheld the High Court&rsquo;s ruling, dismissing Devi&rsquo;s plea and observing that the Senior Citizens Act does not explicitly provide for eviction proceedings.&nbsp;The bench stated that if Kallu Mal had transferred ownership of the house to his daughters and son-in-law, then neither he nor his wife had the right to evict Krishna Kumar. The court also found no evidence that Krishna Kumar had humiliated or mistreated his parents. As a son, Krishna Kumar holds an implied license to reside in the house, and eviction would not be a prudent decision. The SC also said the maintenance tribunal&rsquo;s decision to allow Krishna Kumar to stay with restrictions was justified.&nbsp;&ldquo;In the facts and circumstances of the case, there was no necessity for the extreme step for ordering the eviction of Krishna Kumar from a portion of the house rather the purpose could have been served by ordering maintenance as provided under Section 4/5 of the Senior Citizens Act and by restraining him from harassing the parents and interfering in their day-to-day life,&rdquo; the top court said.&nbsp;",

    "title": "Economist Arthur Laffer warns 25% US tariffs may severely hit automakers",
    "body": "Noted economist Arthur Laffer warns in a new analysis that President Donald Trump&#39;s 25 per cent tariffs on auto imports could add $4,711 to the cost of a vehicle, adding that the proposed taxes could weaken the ability of US automakers to compete with their foreign counterparts.In the 21-page analysis obtained by The Associated Press, Laffer, whom Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2019 for his contributions to economics, says the auto industry would be in a better position if the president preserved the supply chain rules with Canada and Mexico from his own 2019 USMCA trade pact.The White House has temporarily exempted auto and parts imports under the USMCA from the tariffs starting on April 3 so that the Trump administration can put together a process for taxing non-US content in vehicles and parts that fall under the agreement.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Global automakers warn Trump&#39;s tariffs will hurt them, US consumersWithout this exemption, the proposed tariff risks causing irreparable damage to the industry, contradicting the administration&#39;s goals of strengthening US manufacturing and economic stability, Laffer writes in the analysis.A 25 per cent tariff would not only shrink, or possibly eliminate, profit margins for US manufacturers but also weaken their ability to compete with international rivals.While Trump&#39;s tariff plans have frightened the stock market and US consumers, Laffer&#39;s analysis shows the administration has yet to convince even his favoured economists that his import taxes would deliver as promised. The paper reminds Trump that it&#39;s not too late to change course, specifically complimenting the USMCA negotiated in his first term as a significant achievement.The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has served as a cornerstone of President Trump&#39;s first term and has quickly become a dominant feature of North American trade policy, fostering economic growth, stabilizing supply chains, and strengthening the US auto industry, Laffer writes.The analysis says that the per vehicle cost without the USMCA exemption would be $4,711, but that figure would be a lower $2,765 if the exemptions were sustained.Trump honoured Laffer with the highest civilian honour 45 years after the economist famously sketched out on a napkin the Laffer curve showing that there&#39;s an optimal tax rate for collecting revenue.The bell-shaped curve indicated that there&#39;s a tax rate so high that it could be self-defeating for generating tax revenues. Many Republicans embraced the curve as evidence that lower tax rates could generate stronger growth that would lead to higher tax revenues.Dr. Laffer helped inspire, guide, and implement extraordinary economic reforms that recognize the power of human freedom and ingenuity to grow our economy and lift families out of poverty and into a really bright future, Trump said in awarding him the medal.Laffer served on the economic policy advisory board of President Ronald Reagan, in addition to being a university professor. He has his own economic consultancy, Laffer Associates. In 1970, he was the first chief economist of the White House Office of Management and Budget.Laffer also advised Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign and co-wrote a flattering book, Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy.Laffer Associates did not immediately respond to an email from the AP seeking comment Thursday night.Trump maintains that 25 per cent tariffs will cause more foreign and domestic automakers to expand production and open new factories in the United States. On Monday, he celebrated a planned $5.8 billion investment by South Korean automaker Hyundai to build a steel plant in Louisiana as evidence that his strategy would succeed.Trump said the 25 per cent auto tariffs would help to reduce the federal budget deficit while moving more production into the United States.For the most part, I think it&#39;s going to lead cars to be made in one location, Trump told reporters on Wednesday. For right now, the car would be made here, sent to Canada, sent to Mexico, sent to all over the place. It&#39;s ridiculous.",

We conveyed our collective concern and collective disappointment before the Speaker on how the ruling side is violating the traditions, rules and culture of the House,&quot; Gogoi told reporters after the meeting Thursday.He said the main matter was the context and issue over which the Speaker made a statement on the LoP on Wednesday.&quot;He made a reference to Rule 349 and said members and the LoP must follow this. What specific incident he was referring to was not clear. There was politicisation and propaganda over the Speaker&#39;s remarks.

He was not allowed to speak despite his name being taken in the House. The whole country saw it. The LoP is a Constitutional post, remarks were made about him but he was not allowed to speak. There was no clarity on what incident the Speaker was referring to but the BJP IT cell was politicising the issue,&quot; he said, terming the incident saddening.Sources said Gogoi, DMK&#39;s A Raja, SP&#39;s Dharmendra Yadav, TMC&#39;s Kaylan Banerjee, and NCP (SP) Supriya Sule were among the MPs who met the Speaker.&quot;By convention, whenever the LoP stands up, they are usually allowed to speak. This has been documented in Shakdher and Kaul&#39;s parliamentary practices. However, the present government repeatedly denies the LoP an opportunity to speak, even when formally requested,&quot; sources quoted opposition leaders as saying in the letter.This is a departure from past practices, when even in confrontational situations, the LoP was heard, they said.The opposition parties also raised the issue of &quot;non-appointment&quot; of Deputy Speaker in the Lok Sabha.Birla on Wednesday asked Rahul Gandhi to conduct himself in line with the rules of procedure that members are expected to observe to uphold the dignity of the House, prompting the Leader of Opposition to claim that the remarks against him were &quot;unsubstantiated&quot;.",

    "body": "There is a growing significance of semiconductors, particularly driven by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and technologies like ChatGPT, according to industry leaders at the Nano Electronics Roadshow and Conference, hosted at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru.&nbsp;They observed a sharp uptick in semiconductor consumption, with expectations for substantial growth moving forward. The leaders emphasized that India is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, offering advantages such as a favorable geopolitical landscape, a skilled talent pool and cost competitiveness&mdash;all of which could drive economic security and job creation.&nbsp;&ldquo;Semiconductor is the new oil,&rdquo; said Utpal Shah, Senior Vice President of Tata Electronics. &quot;With the advent of AI and ChatGPT, the importance of semiconductors has gone up. It&rsquo;s truly a hockey stick growth in terms of semiconductor consumption across all aspects of life, and this is only expected to grow substantially moving forward.&quot;&nbsp;Shah highlighted the critical role of the semiconductor industry in driving both economic security and job creation. He pointed to examples like Taiwan, where semiconductor output contributes 25 per cent to GDP (gross domestic product), and the U.S., where the industry plays a significant role in economic growth.&nbsp;Shah also explained the broader strategic importance of semiconductors for defence and digital infrastructure. He emphasized that if India aims to become the third-largest economy and fulfill the vision of &quot;Vikshit Bharat 2047,&quot; semiconductor development is crucial.&nbsp;Tata Electronics, is investing a total of $14 billion to build India&#39;s first semiconductor fabrication facility in Gujarat state and a chip-assembly and testing facility in the state of Assam.$110 billion marketIndia&rsquo;s semiconductor demand, currently at $45-50 billion, is expected to reach $100-110 billion by 2030, according to S. Krishnan, Secretary of the Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY).He highlighted the critical role of MeitY&rsquo;s Nano Centers in fostering innovation and talent development to build a semiconductor-ready workforce of 85,000 professionals. &ldquo;A key focus of the ministry is aligning various efforts to advance the India Semiconductor Mission, one of the world&rsquo;s most extensive subsidy and grant programs. With nearly 70-75 per cent of investments in major semiconductor facilities coming from taxpayer money, every Indian is a stakeholder in this mission,&rdquo; said Krishnan. &ldquo;Infact, 20 per cen of the workforce in semiconductor design is in India. Ensuring its success is a collective responsibility shared by the government, industry, and academia.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abhishek Singh, Additional Secretary, MeitY, highlighted the importance of sensors in the development of AI applications, particularly in fields such as healthcare and agriculture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Under the India AI mission, through the INUP (Indian nanoelectronics users program) and other initiatives, startups, entrepreneurs, and researchers are solving real-world problems, driving India to the forefront of cutting-edge technology,&rdquo; said Singh. &ldquo;Together, with the pioneering efforts of institutions like IISc, IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, and others, we are building an ecosystem that ensures India remains a leader in this revolution.&quot;&nbsp;Nanoelectronics plays a pivotal role in making these sensors smaller, cheaper, and more capable of performing multiple functions. Singh pointed out how nanoelectronics has made devices significantly smaller yet vastly more powerful. For instance, the fact that there are 20 billion transistors in a single smartphone shows just how much technology has shrunk&mdash;down to a scale smaller than a human hair. This shrinking has paved the way for advancements in supercomputing, quantum computing, and AI.Tech, talent, capitalRegarding Tata Electronics&#39; entry into the semiconductor industry, Shah of Tata Electronics described three key pillars for success: technology, talent, and capital. He acknowledged that while India has abundant talent and pockets of advanced technology, it lacks a fully integrated commercial-grade semiconductor technology. However, Tata Electronics has partnered with a Taiwanese technology provider to acquire initial technology and is focused on developing indigenous commercial-grade solutions over time.&nbsp;On the capital front, Shah expressed appreciation for the government&#39;s aggressive and comprehensive semiconductor policy, which has been instrumental in advancing Tata Electronics&#39; efforts. The company has benefited significantly from the support provided by the government, enabling progress in the industry.&nbsp;Shah also highlighted India&rsquo;s favorable market conditions, noting that local semiconductor consumption is expected to grow substantially by 2030. He pointed out India&#39;s favorable geopolitical position, cost competitiveness, and environmental sustainability as additional advantages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Many customers have knocked our doors and said, if you have this solution, we would like to have the manufacturing footprint in India, because they see India as a geopolitically favorable region,&rdquo; said Shah. &ldquo;Cost competitiveness is another factor that will come into play, as we are building this industry in India. It&nbsp; will be one of the biggest selling points of India 10 years from now.&rdquo;&nbsp;Since its founding in May 2020, Tata Electronics has made significant strides. The company has established multiple lines of business, including design services, chip manufacturing (foundry), packaging (OSAT), and system-level manufacturing (EMS). Shah, outlined the company&rsquo;s ambitious plans in India&rsquo;s semiconductor industry.He highlighted the establishment of India&rsquo;s first commercial 12-inch semiconductor fab in Gujarat. Tata&rsquo;s upcoming fab would reportedly have a capacity of 50,000 wafers per month, and produce 3 billion chips every year.&nbsp;",

    "body": "The Supreme Court on Thursday said the resolution plan of a stressed company would be binding on a stakeholder even if they were not a party to the proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).&nbsp;The court also said that if such a stakeholder does not raise their claim before the interim resolution professional/resolution professional, the resolution plan as approved by the NCLT would still be binding on them.&nbsp;&ldquo;No doubt that even if any stakeholder is not a party to the proceedings before the NCLT and if such stakeholder does not raise his claim before the interim resolution professional/resolution professional, the resolution plan as approved by the NCLT would still be binding on him,&rdquo; the bench of Justices B R Gavai and Augustine George Masih said.&nbsp;This was on a plea by JSW Ispat Special Products Ltd (now JSW Steel Ltd and petitioner) alleging that officers of the Commercial Tax Department of the State of Chhattisgarh (respondents) had disobeyed the Supreme Court judgment in the case Ghanshyam Mishra and Sons Private Limited v. Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited and others (Ghanshyam Mishra).&nbsp;The court said that despite knowledge of the Ghanshyam Mishra judgment, the respondents still issued demand notices to JSW for a period prior to approval of the resolution plan.&nbsp;The bench observed that once a resolution plan is approved, the resolution applicant starts on a clean slate and thus cannot be flung with surprise claims.&nbsp;&ldquo;It can thus be seen that in view of clear pronouncement of law by this court, all the dues of any of the stakeholders, including the statutory dues owed to the central government, any state government, or any local authority, which were not part of the resolution plan, stood extinguished from the date on which the resolution plan stood approved,&rdquo; the order said.&nbsp;In 2017, insolvency proceedings were initiated against M/s Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd and the resolution plan was approved on July 24, 2018, declaring JSW as the successful resolution applicant.&nbsp;During this time, the State of Chhattisgarh had failed to file a claim when invited by the insolvency resolution professional via public announcement dated July 27, 2017.&nbsp;The court quashed the demand notices of the respondents to the tune of Rs 2.66 crore under the Chhattisgarh Value Added Tax Act, 2005, Rs 1.08 crore under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, and Rs 61 lakh under the Entry Tax Act, 1957, and termed them illegal.&nbsp;&ldquo;Undoubtedly, in the present case, in spite of public notice, neither the State of Chhattisgarh nor its authorities raised any claim before the committee of creditors (CoC). In that view of the matter, we are of the considered view that the case of the present petitioner is specifically covered by the judgment of this court in the case of Ghanshyam Mishra (supra), which judgment was brought to the notice of the respondents/authorities. The respondents/authorities could not have proceeded with the recovery proceedings,&rdquo; the judgment said.&nbsp;The court, however, noted that though the acts of the respondents were contemptuous in nature, no stern action would be taken against them in light of the unconditional apology tendered by them to the petitioner.",

In a democracy, the government listens to the people and speaks up. Let us not be under the illusion that an autocratic system will be better, he said.",

Whereas, the Bank Nifty and the MidCap Nifty ended with a gain of 5.8 per cent and 5.1 per cent, respectively; thanks largely to a sharp pullback in the latter half of the month.&nbsp; Amid the market rally, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) seemed to have covered substantial short bets in index futures. The FIIs long-short ratio in index futures now stands at 0.66 - its highest point since December 13, 2024. This ratio implies that FIIs roughly hold 3 short positions across index futures for every 2 long bets.&nbsp; In comparison, at the start of the March series FIIs long-short ratio stood at the lowest point at 0.19 - implying presence of more than 5 short bets in index futures for every long trade.&nbsp; Data from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) futures & options (F&O) segment shows that FIIs hold little over 60,000 index contracts on the long side as against 90,600-odd contracts on the short side. Same time last month, FIIs held mere 41,780-odd contracts long, and over 215,300-odd contracts on the short side.&nbsp; FIIs have been net buyers in the derivatives segment for the last 9 straight trading sessions, with net purchases totalling up to ₹17,433.78 crore. FIIs open interest (OI) in Nifty futures now stand at 80,047 contracts, Bank Nifty (44,757 contracts) and MidCap Nifty (24,443 contracts).&nbsp; Meanwhile, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) are starting the April series with a long-short ratio of 2.44 - implying presence of nearly 5 bullish positions for every 3 bearish bets. This ratio at the start of the derivatives series is the highest for DIIs in more than a year.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Marico, Lodha, AU SFB see high rollovers, IndusInd Bk low; check full list&nbsp; In contrast, retail investors&rsquo; long-short ratio has dropped to 1.07 - its lowest point since October 4, 2024. Retail investors&#39; now hold an equal quantity of long and short positions in index futures. Proprietary traders&#39; long-short ratio has dropped to 0.42, and seems to be the most bearish among market participants at present.&nbsp; Technically, the Nifty has garnered strong support at its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), emphasizing a robust foothold for buyers, said Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Analyst at SAMCO Securities in a note.&nbsp; Additionally, the momentum indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) remains perched above the 60-mark on the daily chart, while the Nifty continues to trade comfortably above key moving averages, indicating that pullbacks can be seen as buying opportunities, the analyst said.&nbsp; The derivatives market, however, depicts a slightly bearish bias, with Call writers holding the upper hand over Put writers, hinting at a dip in trader&rsquo;s confidence.&nbsp; Heavy Call writing at the 24,000 strike has established it as a formidable resistance, while substantial Put writing at the 23,500 level underlines strong support, reinforcing bullish sentiment at the lower end. The 23,500 &ndash; 23,300 range has transformed into a key accumulation zone, backed by aggressive Put additions, whereas the 23,700 &ndash; 24,000 territory faces notable resistance due to persistent Call writing, Dhupesh explained in the note.&nbsp; Additionally, the Put-Call Ratio (PCR) climbed from 0.81 to 0.86, reflecting cautious positioning among traders. With the Max Pain level stationed at 23,500, bulls continue to absorb selling pressure, setting the stage for a potential continuation of the upward trajectory, the note added.&nbsp; Among individual stocks, Bajaj Finserv, Paytm, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), Persistent Systems, Jubilant Foodworks, Ambuja Cements, Trent and Bank of Baroda have seen consistent buying interest in the last 4 trading sessions. On the other hand, Zomato, Vodafone Idea, Sona BLW Precision, Dr. Reddy&#39;s, Indian Hotels and Lupin saw a selling bias.&nbsp;",

    "title": "BSE share price surges 12%, zooms 42% from March low; here's why",
    "body": "BSE share price: Shares of BSE Limited surged 12 per cent to ₹5,225 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in Friday&rsquo;s intra-day trade amid heavy volumes after the rival of India&#39;s oldest stock exchange -- NSE -- deferred its plan to change the day of expiring of its contracts from Thursday to Monday. This comes after the release of a consultation paper from market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Thursday.&nbsp;Meanwhile, in the past two trading days, the stock price of BSE has surged 17 per cent after the exchange and data platform company announced to consider bonus issue in a meeting on March 30, 2025. The company made the announcement on Wednesday, March 26, 2025 after market hours.&nbsp;This will be the second time in the past three years the BSE will consider bonus issue, according to the corporate action data compiled by NSE. Earlier, the company had issued bonus shares in the ratio of 2:1 i.e. shareholders receive two additional shares for every share they hold.&nbsp;At 09:36 am; BSE&rsquo;s shares were quoting 11 per cent higher at ₹5,204.45, as compared to 0.33 per cent decline in Nifty 50. As many as 3.78 million equity shares of the company have changed hands in the first 21 minutes of trading on the NSE, the exchange data shows.&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock has recovered 42 per cent from its low of ₹3,682 touched on March 11, 2025. The market price of BSE had hit a record high of ₹6,133.40 on January 20, 2025.&nbsp;Sebi has released a consultation paper proposing to limit expiries of all equity derivative contracts of an exchange to either Tuesday or Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim is to ensure ideal spacing of expiry days to reduce concentration risk and promote product innovation. This is beneficial for BSE because its current expiry day is Tuesday and a shift in NSE expiry to Monday from April 2025 is expected to impact BSE&rsquo;s volumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of this consultation paper will allow spaced-out days for both BSE and NSE.&nbsp;Currently, the BSE and NSE use Tuesday and Thursday, respectively, as expiry days for single stock and index derivatives contracts, a practice formalised in January 2025.&nbsp;NSE recently proposed shifting its final settlement day to Monday, prompting Sebi to step in and formalise the framework. Given Sebi&#39;s latest proposal, the exchange may have to withdraw the plan.&nbsp;The move to standardise the expiry days of equity derivatives contracts across stock exchanges is aimed at balancing market stability, investor protection, and innovation.&nbsp;Sebi&rsquo;s proposed measures include expiries of all equity derivative contracts of an exchange will be limited to either Tuesday or Thursday. Contracts other than benchmark index options, which have monthly expiry, will have an expiry date on the last week of every month on either Tuesday or Thursday, as chosen by the exchange. Exchanges will now require SEBI&rsquo;s prior approval to launch or modify any contract expiry or settlement day.&nbsp;According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the implementation of this proposal is expected to be positive for BSE. Considering the shift in expiry of NSE contracts to Monday from April 2025, BSE&rsquo;s volumes are expected to be impacted. However, since BSE already has contract expiry on Tuesday, NSE will have to probably stick to Thursday expiry, which will result in a steady growth trajectory for BSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;With BSE expiry ahead of NSE, the benefit of time decay is expected to remain intact, and BSE&rsquo;s market share gain story is expected to continue. Nevertheless, the concern about the implementation of the consultation paper on entity-level limits remains a risk, the brokerage firm said in a note.&nbsp;",

    "title": "Macquarie initiates 'outperform' rating on Trent; Sees 30% upside for stock",
    "body": "Macquarie initiated coverage on India&#39;s fashion retailer Trent with an &#39;outperform&#39; rating, highlighting a strong supply chain and a recovery in discretionary demand. The rating offers relief to the stock, which has been hammered amid growth woes this year.&nbsp;Shares of the Tata Group company have been among the top Nifty losers this year with a decline of nearly 24 per cent. Macquarie cites this correction to near-term growth concerns, recalibration of growth expectations for Zudio and competitive concerns linked to Shein and domestic players.&nbsp;&nbsp;The brokerage noted that the growth rates in the discretionary space have moderated in the recent quarters. However, tax rebates announced in the budget could aid a sharper recovery in small-ticket discretionary items, Macquarie said in a note on Thursday. &quot;This should lead to growth momentum recovery across the small-ticket discretionary space.&quot;&nbsp;The research firm goes on to say that Trent has &quot;Asia&#39;s best retailing metrics and is a play on India&#39;s rising discretionary spend in fashion.&quot; Macquarie believes that Trent&#39;s supply chain strengths and design capabilities, built with years of experience of Indian design sensibilities/fabric sourcing, are difficult to replicate.&nbsp;&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;NSE defers switching to Monday expiry after Sebi&#39;s consultation paper&nbsp;Analysts at the firm see room for continued store additions in Zudio, given its &#39;value for money&#39; positioning and other fashion brands&#39; higher city presence. Trent&#39;s proven ability to balance fashion risk with profitability through frequent style drops and its expansion through owned/franchisee stores have aided its performance, they said in the note.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the research firm said that Trent&#39;s Star Bazaar grocery format -- operated via JV with Tesco PLC -- will see a gradual reduction in losses despite quick-commerce linked growth uncertainties. This will be aided by its focus on private brands, fresh produce, sharper pricing and store operational expenditure optimisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Macquarie thinks that the competitive concerns about Shein&#39;s entry are overblown. This is because it would be difficult for Shein to replicate its China production cost advantage with an India-based supply chain. &quot;This re-entry comes with strict conditions on control, with all operations/data managed by Reliance Retail and Shein only a technological partner,&quot; it noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;CLSA bullish on Airtel, Tata Comm; sees data business driving growthMacquarie has assigned a 12-month target price of ₹7,000 per share, which implies about 30 per cent upside from the current price. The research firm assigned a target price of ₹10,000 under its bull-case scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent correction offers a good entry point into Trent with the ability to benefit from increasing consumer demand for discretionary apparel. The stock was among the top losers this year after it was the best-performing Nifty stock in 2024. The counter rallied 133 per cent last calendar year, after seeing a surge of 126 per cent in the year before. The sharp fall in the counter this year has cut down the price-to-earnings multiple from 156x in October last year to 119x currently.&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, shares of the retailer rose as much as 0.70 per cent to ₹5,460 per share. As of 9:42 AM, the stock was trading 0.05 per cent higher, compared to a 0.31 per cent decline in the benchmark Nifty50 index.&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the 24 analysts tracking the Tata Group company, 17 have a &#39;buy&#39; rating on the stock, three have a &#39;hold&#39; call, while another 4 suggest &#39;sell&#39;, according to Bloomberg data.&nbsp;&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Stock Market LIVE Updates: Sensex falls 100 pts; Broader indices rise; BSE jumps 10%, M&M slides 3%&nbsp;",

Nikkei was down 2 per cent, while Topix was down over 2.15 per cent each. Kospi slipped 1.94 per cent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors continued to focus on shares of automakers, which saw a dip on Thursday after Trump announced a 25 per cent tariff on &lsquo;all cars that are not made in the United States.&rsquo; However, Trump&rsquo;s recent comments about the upcoming April 2 tariffs have alleviated some concerns. He mentioned that the tariffs would be &ldquo;very lenient&rdquo; and expressed a willingness to reduce tariffs on China in order to facilitate a deal with ByteDance&#39;s TikTok.&nbsp;Trump also used tariffs as a bargaining chip on Thursday, warning that he could impose &lsquo;far larger&rsquo; duties on the EU and Canada if they united to oppose the tariffs.&nbsp;In the US, all three major stock indexes ended lower overnight.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was placing 25 per cent tariff on auto imports, a move that the White House claims would foster domestic manufacturing but could also put a financial squeeze on automakers that depend on global supply chains.&quot;This will continue to spur growth. We&#39;ll effectively be charging a 25 per cent tariff,&quot; Trump told reporters.&nbsp;The tariffs could be complicated as even US automakers source their components from around the world, meaning that they could face higher costs and lower sales.Shares in General Motors have fallen roughly 3 per cent in Wednesday afternoon trading. Ford&#39;s stock was up slightly. Shares in Stellantis, the owner of Jeep and Chrysler, have dropped nearly 4 per cent.Trump has long said that tariffs against auto imports would be a defining policy of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would cause more production to relocate to the United States.&nbsp;ALSO READ |&nbsp;Trump likely to use 2019 trade probe to justify 25% auto import tariffsBut US and foreign automakers with domestic plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles, meaning that auto prices could increase and sales could decline as new factories take time to build.&quot;We are going to be doing automobiles, which you&#39;ve known about for a long time. We&#39;ll be announcing that fairly soon, over the next few days probably,&quot; Trump said on Monday.The auto tariffs are part of a broader reshaping of global relations by Trump, who plans to impose what he calls &quot;reciprocal&quot; taxes on April 2 that would match the tariffs, sales taxes charged by other nations.Trump has already placed a 20 per cent import tax on all imports from China for its role in the production of fentanyl. He similarly placed 25 per cent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, with a lower 10 per cent tax on Canadian energy products.Parts of the Mexico and Canada tariffs have been suspended, including the taxes on autos, after automakers objected and Trump responded by giving them a 30-day reprieve that is set to expire in April.The president has also imposed 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, removing the exemptions from his earlier 2018 taxes on the metals.He also plans tariffs on computer chips, pharmaceutical drugs, lumber and copper.&nbsp;ALSO READ |&nbsp;Canadian PM Carney calls Trump&#39;s auto tariffs &#39;direct attack&#39; on countryTrump&#39;s taxes risk igniting a broader global trade war with escalating retaliations that could crush global trade, potentially hurting economic growth while raising prices for families and businesses as some of the costs of the taxes get passed along by importers.When the European Union retaliated with plans for a 50 per cent tariff on US spirits, Trump responded by planning a 200 per cent tax on alcoholic beverages from the EU.Trump also intends to place a 25 per cent tariff on countries that import oil from Venezuela, even though the United States also imports oil from that nation.Trump&#39;s aides maintain that the tariffs on Canada and Mexico are about stopping illegal immigration and drug smuggling. But the administration also wants to use the tariff revenues to lower the budget deficit and assert America&#39;s preeminence as the world&#39;s largest economy.The president on Monday cited plans by South Korean automaker Hyundai to build a USD 5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana as evidence that tariffs would bring back manufacturing jobs.Slightly more than one million people are employed domestically in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts, about 320,000 fewer than in 2000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Another 2.1 million people work at auto and parts dealerships.The United States last year imported nearly 8 million cars and light trucks worth USD 244 billion.Mexico, Japan and South Korea were the top sources of foreign vehicles.Imports of auto parts came to more than USD 197 billion, led by Mexico, Canada and China, according to the Commerce Department.",

    "body": "Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, remained range-bound on Friday, March 28, 2025. Bitcoin attempted a recovery above $86,800 but is struggling to clear key resistance levels around $88,000 to $88,200. However, it is holding steady above $87,200 after bulls defended the support at $85,900.&nbsp;At around 10:30 AM on Friday, Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency, was quoted trading at around $86,174.94, down 1.51 per cent. BTC has traded in the range of $87,702.17 to $85,837.93 in the last 24 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 24-hour trading volume for the flagship currency is $23.08 billion, while its market capitalisation stands at approximately $1,709.9 billion, according to data sources from Binance.&nbsp;A successful breakout above the $88,000 to $88,200 levels, Riya Sehgal, research analyst at Delta Exchange, said, could reignite bullish momentum. Until then, however, the market remains vulnerable to further downside.&nbsp;&nbsp;The escalation of trade tensions following US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s tariff announcement, Sehgal believes, has injected fresh volatility into traditional markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors, analysts said, are now awaiting the Core Personal Consumer Price Index (PCE) data due later today, as it could alter the US Fed&rsquo;s narrative&mdash;impacting the decision on rate cuts.&nbsp;&quot;Historically, periods of heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty have seen digital assets like Bitcoin viewed as alternative stores of value, although their correlation with risk assets remains evident in the short term. On a positive note, Bitcoin ETFs continue to see steady inflows, signaling institutional interest,&quot; Sehgal said.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH), which is the world&rsquo;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, is facing a similar trajectory, failing to maintain strength above $2,100 and now testing support below $2,040. Ethereum was quoted trading at around $2,003.24, down 0.77 per cent.&nbsp;Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder of Mudrex, believes that Ethereum is gearing up for a potential relief rally. According to CoinGlass data, futures traders have committed 10.84 million ETH in open interest, signaling renewed confidence among ETH holders. This, Patel said, signals renewed confidence among ETH holders.&nbsp;That said, the other popular cryptocurrencies were also trading lower, with Ripple (XRP) trading down by nearly 4 per cent, and Solana (SOL) down by 3 per cent. Binance Coin (BNB), on the other hand, traded higher by nearly 1 per cent.&nbsp;",

The hard-earned money of employees which have been mandatorily deducted and employer&#39;s share is not credited to the employee&#39;s EPFO account. In such instance when any grievance of such type is received by the Department, the Committee feels that it should take up with EPFO (Employees&#39; Provident Fund Organisation),&quot; reads the report.The Committee appreciated the 10-step CPGRAMS (Centralised Public Grievances Redress and Monitoring System) reforms process that was adopted by DARPG for improving the quality of grievance disposal and reducing the time lines.The CPGRAMS allows citizens to raise grievances against government departments.&quot;The Committee commends the Department for faster rate of disposal of grievances by reducing the average disposal time from 32 days in 2021 to 16 days in May 2023,&quot; the report said.To further improve the disposal rate, the panel recommended the DARPG to integrate state portals with CPGRAMS, standardise naming conventions, and establish a feedback mechanism to monitor and enhance the quality of grievance redressal, it said.",

The currency snapped its nine-consecutive day of gains on Tuesday, marking an end to the best winning streak since January 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;The currency has appreciated by 1.86 per cent in March so far, tracking the fall in the dollar index. Meanwhile, during the current financial year, it witnessed a 2.1 per cent fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupee should be range bound unless the decision on the US delegation negotiating the tariffs comes out, according to Anil Kumar Bhansali, head of treasury and executive director at Finrex Treasury Advisors LLP. &quot;An adjustment in spot due to year end premium is expected apart from a falling risk appetite.&quot; US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was placing 25 per cent tariff on auto imports.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rupee traded flat as market participants awaited the US GDP numbers, according to Jateen Trivedi, VP research analyst - commodity and currency at LKP Securities.

The move has reignited fears of a global trade war, fuelling inflation concerns and causing ripples across currency markets, he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the current global and domestic market dynamics, the rupee-dollar pair is expected to find strong support around 85.40-85.50, with the potential for a rebound towards 86.50 in the short term, pabari said. &quot;In the medium term, any uptick in dollar/rupee could present selling opportunities, while a continued improvement in India&rsquo;s economic fundamentals may push the rupee toward 85.20.&quot;&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Oil holds near one-month high as markets weigh new trade war risks&nbsp;Foreign institutional investors remained net buyers of ₹2,240.55 crore from Indian equities on Wednesday.

    "title": "RBI to cut rates again on April 9, one more expected in August: Poll",
    "body": "The Reserve Bank of India will cut interest rates at a second straight meeting on April 9, with just one more cut expected in August, which would mark the shortest easing cycle on record, a Reuters poll of economists found.&nbsp;With inflation in India easing to a seven-month low of 3.61 per cent in February and the economy forecast to grow at 6.4 per cent this fiscal year, the weakest in four years, the central bank has room to cut rates further.&nbsp;A strong majority of economists, 54 of 60 in the March 18-27 Reuters poll, expected the RBI to cut its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.00 per cent at the conclusion of its April 7-9 meeting.&nbsp;One respondent predicted a 50 basis point cut, while the remaining five expected no change.&nbsp;&quot;There are not many strong growth drivers going into fiscal year 2026...they (RBI) need to sustain their support to growth.Inflation has also created a lot of room for them to ease. So I think they should utilise that space and sort of recalibrate monetary policy,&quot; said Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ.&nbsp;&quot;They have injected liquidity, so that&#39;s covering some part of the liquidity deficit, that&#39;s good. But I think the rates also need to fall now because we have seen a palpable slowdown in consumption and investment and the real rates need to adjust from that perspective.&quot;&nbsp;The RBI has injected about $64 billion of rupees into the banking system over the last few months to increase money supply, which economists said was needed for rate cuts to work their way into the broader economy.&nbsp;However, several economists in the poll said it would take a few more months for that to happen.&nbsp;&quot;If transmission needs to happen, especially in a rate-cutting cycle, (banking sector) liquidity needs to be on the positive side,&quot; said Indranil Pan, chief economist at Yes Bank.&nbsp;Pan added liquidity will start to improve in the upcoming financial year, beginning in April 2025, as government expenditures also pick up pace.&nbsp;SHALLOWEST RATE-CUT CYCLE EVER&nbsp;Median forecasts in the poll showed the RBI will keep interest rates at 6.00 per cent in the June 4-6 meeting. However, a narrow majority of economists, 29 of 49, expected the interest rate to fall to 5.75 per cent in the August meeting, a view unchanged from last month.&nbsp;This is expected to be followed by a prolonged pause until at least the first half of next year. With a total of 75 basis points in rate cuts this cycle, it will be the shortest easing cycle since early 2000, when the RBI began using the repo rate as its main policy tool.&nbsp;&quot;I think this is going to be a shallow rate cut cycle to begin with...Depending on what happens on the global front, drags of capital outflows and what the U.S. Fed does,&quot; said Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC bank.&nbsp;&quot;We were always of the view that there will be a maximum of three rate cuts that the RBI will deliver...Beyond the cut in April, we remain divided between June and August.&quot;&nbsp;(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

    "title": "Why SC ruling on GST error corrections is a major relief for businesses",
    "body": "The Supreme Court recently held that companies can rectify clerical or arithmetical errors in Goods and Services Tax (GST) filings and they should not be penalised for doing this.&nbsp; This decision upheld businesses&rsquo; right to correct such mistakes without facing penalties or denial of Input Tax Credit (ITC), as long as there is no revenue loss.&nbsp;&ldquo;The court has noted that human errors and mistakes are normal, and errors are also made by the Revenue department. The court has stated that the right to correct mistakes in the nature of clerical or arithmetical error is a right that flows from the right to do business. The right to do business is protected by the Constitution of India. The Court has held that software limitation cannot be a good justification as software is meant to ease compliance and can be configured,&rdquo; said Kamal Aggarwal, Senior Advisor, Singhania & Co.&nbsp;Ankit Jain, Partner, Ved Jain and Associates, said, &ldquo;Businesses are generally required to file at least two returns a month (GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B), and some businesses may even be required to file more depending on their operations. This makes the process of filing tax returns extremely cumbersome and prone to errors, especially when handling vast volumes of transactions.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;One of the most significant challenges that businesses face is when there is a mismatch between data across any of these returns. The GST system automatically detects such discrepancies and calculates the tax liability accordingly. This results in notices being issued to taxpayers, demanding payment of the tax due, often including penalties. This automated system of error detection, while well-intentioned, often leads to additional complications for businesses that have made honest, inadvertent mistakes while filing. This is where the recent Supreme Court ruling comes as a major relief,&rdquo; Jain said.&nbsp;How will small and medium enterprises benefit?&nbsp;&ldquo;This ruling is particularly crucial for small and medium enterprises, which may lack sophisticated accounting systems and are more prone to clerical mistakes. While this judgment sets a broader precedent for a more business-friendly tax regime, it is unclear how the same will be executed as no mechanics have yet been announced,&rdquo; said Kunal Savani, Partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.&nbsp;Calculate Income Tax: Income Tax Calculator Tool&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The GST system should evolve to incorporate provisions for rectifying errors, particularly minor clerical errors, without penalty, and provide businesses with a clear, simple process for doing so. This would not only reduce the burden on taxpayers but also foster a culture of compliance, where businesses are encouraged to be accurate without the fear of severe repercussions for small, genuine mistakes,&rdquo; Jain said.",

With refusal rates rising from 35% in 2023 to 50% last year, the numbers point to a marked shift in immigration handling.&nbsp;According to data obtained by the Toronto Star, a Canadian daily, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) rejected 2,359,157 temporary resident applications in 2024, up from 1,846,180 the previous year.&nbsp;Visitor visas see sharpest jump in rejections&nbsp;&lt; 1.95 million visitor visa applications were refused in 2024, making up 54% of all such requests&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; In 2023, the visitor visa refusal rate stood at 40%&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; Study permit refusals rose to 52%&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; Work permit rejections were 22%, slightly lower than 23% in 2023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase comes amid growing pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&rsquo;s government to reduce temporary immigration, following public concern over housing shortages and the rising cost of living.&nbsp;In response, Canada has reduced its permanent residency targets for the coming three years. The cap will drop to 395,000 in 2025, then fall to 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027.&nbsp;Ottawa has also begun encouraging temporary residents to leave once their permits expire, while keeping some pathways open for those eligible to transition to permanent status.&nbsp;More people staying on visitor records&nbsp;Despite a firmer stance on new visas, internal data shows many are choosing to stay in Canada by switching to visitor records. These allow people to remain in the country legally, though without study or work rights.&nbsp;Visitor record applications nearly doubled from 196,965 in 2019 to 389,254 in 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;Refusal rates for visitor records remained low at around 5%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backlog continues to shrink&nbsp;IRCC&rsquo;s processing times have shown some improvement. The backlog stood at 821,200 files in March, 2025&mdash;a drop of 7.95% from 892,100 in January. It marks the third straight month the backlog has remained under the 1 million mark.&nbsp;In total, there were 2,029,400 immigration applications in the system at the end of February. Of these, 1,208,200 were processed within IRCC&rsquo;s service standards, which vary depending on the type of application.&nbsp;Student interest in top destinations declines&nbsp;Canada isn&rsquo;t the only country seeing a drop in international student interest. According to a study by MSM Unify, a global education company, student visa applications to major Anglophone countries fell sharply in 2024.&nbsp;&lt; Canada saw a 46% drop in student applications, from 868,000 in 2023 to 469,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; Australia recorded a 36% decline, with processed applications falling from 390,000 to 176,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; The UK and the US recorded smaller drops&mdash;16% and 11%, respectively&nbsp;&nbsp;UK applications stood at 294,000, and the US at 322,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall is being linked to tighter visa rules, including stricter financial requirements, deeper scrutiny of student intent, and changes to post-study work rights&mdash;especially in Canada and Australia.&nbsp;Students face financial pressure and uncertainty&nbsp;New rules for Canada&rsquo;s Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) have caused uncertainty for students. These changes, combined with global inflation, have pushed up the cost of living in countries like the UK and US&mdash;making it harder for international students to afford tuition and daily expenses.&nbsp;&ldquo;Uncertainties around post-graduation work options have contributed significantly to declining interest in applications to these countries,&rdquo; said Mamta Shekhawat, founder of Gradding.com, a study abroad platform.&nbsp;She said the rising cost of living has made it difficult for students to sustain themselves while studying abroad.&nbsp;&ldquo;Apart from strict immigration policies and visa rejections, diplomatic disagreements among countries have also been a major reason for this transformation,&rdquo; she told Business Standard.&nbsp;&ldquo;Opportunities are endless, but we must adapt and guide students in making the right career choices. Some countries are tightening immigration, while others are opening doors. Indian students should prioritise destinations with a strong job market. We always advise thorough research and exploring unconventional options. Many see visa restrictions as limiting, but we believe they encourage us to broaden our horizons,&rdquo; she said.",

As they pack their travel bags, they have two options to make payments abroad: Forex or credit cards.&nbsp;Forex card&nbsp;Forex cards are prepaid and designed for international travel. They can be loaded with foreign currency before departure, allowing travelers to avoid fluctuating exchange rates while abroad. One of the primary advantages of forex cards is that they lock in the exchange rate at the time of loading, providing predictability in spending.&nbsp;A credit card, on the other hand, offers convenience and flexibility. You do not need to preload it. You can pay in multiple currencies. Plus, you earn reward points and enjoy benefits like travel insurance and airport lounge access. However, it may incur some charges such as foreign transaction fees, currency conversion etc.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you want cost control and fixed exchange rates, go for a forex card. If you prefer flexibility and perks, a credit card may suit you. Ideally, carry both. A forex card for most expenses and a credit card for emergencies or big-ticket items.

Its been a tough year for luxury, telecommunications and real estate, as per the Hurun Global Wealth report of 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wealth story begins with the resounding success of AI, where figures like Jensen Huang of Nvidia basked in the limelight, seeing his wealth soar past the US$100 bn mark. Despite owning a mere 3% of Nvidia, Huang had positioned himself at the heart of AI innovation, as Nvidia&rsquo;s GPUs became the very infrastructure powering AI technology. It wasn&rsquo;t just Huang. Liang Wenfeng of DeepSeek and Sam Altman of OpenAI entered the ranks of AI billionaires, their fortunes rising with the rapid adoption of AI tools and technologies. Altman&rsquo;s wealth reached US$1.8bn after OpenAI reshaped its business model, moving from its original not-for-profit structure into a more traditional, for-profit venture.&nbsp;On the other hand, tech investors like Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone, Ken Griffin of Citadel, and Leon Black of Apollo had good years as money managers. Despite a challenging global environment, these titans of finance found opportunities to grow their wealth through sharp investments and deft market moves.&nbsp;But it wasn&rsquo;t all triumphs. For luxury giants like Bernard Arnault of LVMH and Francoise Bettencourt Meyers of L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al, the year was tough. The slowdown in the Chinese market, coupled with the end of the pandemic-driven &lsquo;revenge spending&rsquo; boom, led to a significant decline in luxury consumption. The luxury sector took a hit, and with it, the fortunes of some of the wealthiest families in Europe shrank by billions.&nbsp;Biggest Gainers&nbsp;&nbsp;In China, the once-reliable markets of telecommunications and real estate struggled under the weight of an economy in transition. The restructuring of China&rsquo;s economy was evident in the drop-off of over 80 billionaires, with real estate magnates like Huang Zheng of Pinduoduo taking a significant hit. Meanwhile, tech giants like Zhang Yiming of ByteDance and Pony Ma of Tencent had stellar performances, riding the wave of social media and entertainment&rsquo;s dominance, proving that even amid economic flux, some sectors could still flourish.&nbsp;Top 10 Drops in Wealth:&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the US had a banner year. Donald Trump&rsquo;s election win proved to be a significant catalyst for the fortunes of American billionaires. Elon Musk, whose wealth had already soared with his ventures in Tesla and SpaceX, saw an incredible 82% increase in his net worth, reaching a staggering US$420bn. Close allies like Peter Thiel and the tech world&rsquo;s biggest names thrived under the wave of optimism following Trump&rsquo;s victory. However, the rollercoaster ride didn&rsquo;t stop there. Musk&rsquo;s wealth dipped dramatically when Tesla&#39;s market value plummeted by US$700bn amid mounting competition from Chinese EV makers and controversies surrounding Musk&#39;s political stances. Even with the dip, Musk remained the richest man in the world, showcasing the volatility of billionaire fortunes.&nbsp;The rise of Bitcoin also left its mark. With the value of the cryptocurrency breaching the symbolic US$100,000 mark, the fortunes of crypto founders skyrocketed. CZ Zhao of Binance saw his wealth balloon to US$22bn, while Brian Armstrong of Coinbase hit US$11bn. Even the Winklevoss twins, founders of Gemini, saw their wealth nearly double. Crypto billionaires witnessed an 80% year-on-year growth, making them some of the biggest beneficiaries of the changing economic landscape.&nbsp;Yet, the rise of wealth in America and the burgeoning fortunes of tech giants weren&rsquo;t just confined to the borders of Silicon Valley. Immigrant billionaires flocked to the United States in droves, bolstering its status as the global capital of wealth creation. With New York emerging as the billionaire capital once again, the USA&rsquo;s dominance in sectors like Financial Services, Media & Entertainment, and Software continued, making it a beacon for aspiring moguls worldwide. The country also saw a boost in the number of female billionaires, reaching 130, second only to China.&nbsp;But while the US surged, China&rsquo;s billionaire landscape showed cracks. While China added 91 new billionaires, it also saw a significant number&mdash;over 80&mdash;drop off the list. This was a result of the ongoing restructuring of the Chinese economy, which had been heavily reliant on sectors like Healthcare, New Energy, and Manufacturing, many of which faced headwinds this year. The luxury sector, too, felt the pressure, contributing to a general downturn in the fortunes of some of China&#39;s most prominent billionaires.&nbsp;The Middle East, too, had a remarkable year. Despite the turbulence caused by the war in Gaza, billionaires in countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Israel thrived. These regions, evolving in terms of economic landscapes and diversification, saw a new wave of billionaires, especially in industries like energy and tech.&nbsp;But amidst these fortunes, the story of big philanthropy seemed to be lagging behind. While billionaires collectively added a staggering US$1.6 trillion to their wealth, only a handful of them gave away over US$1bn. Warren Buffett, as always, was the most generous, donating US$5.3bn, primarily to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Michael Bloomberg and Reed Hastings were also notable donors, but the trend of billionaires&rsquo; wealth far outpacing their charitable contributions remained a striking paradox.&nbsp;As the world&rsquo;s wealthiest moved and shook, the Hurun report highlighted an intriguing aspect of global wealth: how billionaires were spread across the globe. The USA now had 870 billionaires, reclaiming its crown as the wealth capital of the world, followed closely by China with 823 billionaires. Even as the landscape of wealth continued to evolve, these two nations remained the undisputed powerhouses of global fortunes.&nbsp;For those keeping track, the total number of billionaires had reached a new world record of 3,442, and the &lsquo;Ten-zero club&rsquo; (those with over US$10bn) had grown substantially. The rise of the &lsquo;11-zero club&rsquo; (billionaires with over US$100bn) saw 17 members, up from none just eight years ago.&nbsp;Where Billionaires LiveThe USA overtook China for the first time since 2016 as the world capital for billionaires, with 870 billionaires, up 70. China followed with 823 billionaires, up 9, reversing a two-decade drop in its number of billionaires. Together, these two countries continue to dominate the global billionaire landscape.&nbsp;Ranked third, India is home to 284 billionaires, and 13 new ones have joined. Singapore jumped three places to 13 th , overtaking Indonesia, Thailand, and Japan in the process. Other countries that did well included Russia, Canada, Turkey, and Mexico.&nbsp;By city, New York is back again as the billionaire capital of the world, with London in second place. Shanghai became the Asian Billionaire Capital for the first time.&nbsp;USA Regains Top Spot&nbsp;The USA reclaimed its position as the country with the most billionaires, totaling 870.Added 96 new billionaires, with only 17 drop-offs, showcasing strong entrepreneurial growth.New York remains the world&rsquo;s billionaire capital, home to 129 billionaires.American billionaires contribute 42% of the total wealth on the list, with 45 in the Hurun Top 100.Leads in immigrant billionaires with 206 and remains a hub for global wealth creation.Dominant sectors include Financial Services (170), Media & Entertainment (111), and Software & Services (106).The USA has 130 women billionaires, second only to China, mainly from inherited wealth.&nbsp;China Falls to Second Place&nbsp;China slipped to second place with 823 billionaires, after adding 91 and losing 82.Shanghai is the top city with over 92 billionaires.China contributes 16% of the total wealth, with the highest number of self-made billionaires (90%).Leading industries include Industrial Products (98), Consumer Goods (95), and Healthcare (73).&nbsp;India&rsquo;s Continued Growth&nbsp;India maintained third place with 284 billionaires, adding 45 new faces.Mumbai is home to 90 billionaires.Indian billionaires contribute 7% of the total wealth on the list, with 7 in the Hurun Top 100.42 emigrant billionaires, mainly to the US, with only 6 immigrant billionaires.Key industries: Healthcare (53), Consumer Goods (35), and Industrial Products (32).Gautam Adani saw a 13% wealth surge, securing 18th globally, while Mukesh Ambani remains India&rsquo;s richest person.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "title": "Indian Rupee opens stronger at 85.71/$; Set for 2.5% drop in FY25",
    "body": "The Indian Rupee opened stronger against the Dollar on the last trading day of the current financial year 2025, as revival of foreign inflows capped the rise in dollar and crude oil prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic currency opened 7 paise stronger at 85.71 against the greenback after closing at 85.79 on Thursday, according to Bloomberg data. The currency has appreciated by 2.13 per cent in March so far, tracking the fall in the dollar index. Meanwhile, during the current financial year, it witnessed a 2.6 per cent fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian rupee stumbled on Thursday due to mounting global uncertainties and robust month-end dollar demand from importers, according to Amit Pabari, managing director at CR Forex Advisors. &quot;The currency&rsquo;s slide was worsened by escalating trade tensions and a rally in crude oil prices.&quot; Given India&rsquo;s heavy reliance on oil imports, the rise in crude prices amplified concerns over the country&rsquo;s trade deficit, further weighing on the rupee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, a stronger-than-expected US GDP growth at 2.4 per cent supported the dollar index, intensifying the downward pressure on the rupee. The dollar surged to a three-week high following Trump&rsquo;s auto tariff announcement on Thursday. The dollar index &mdash; a measure of the value of the US dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies &mdash; was down 0.07 per cent at 104.26. The dollar index was down by 3.26 per cent in March, the highest since November 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Stock Market LIVE Updates: Sensex, Nifty flat with positive bias in pre-open; Rupee opens higher&nbsp;Over the past six sessions, foreign investors have pumped over ₹32,488.6 crore into Indian equities. Global funds have pulled out ₹1.24 trillion from domestic stocks so far this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the current global and domestic market dynamics, the dollar-rupee pair is likely to find strong support in the 85.40-85.50 range, Pabari said. &quot;On the upside, 85.90 will serve as a key resistance level, and a breakout above this could open the path toward 86.40-86.50.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;For the day, we expect a range of 85.60/86.00 as we close today the week, month, quarter and year,&quot; Anil Kumar Bhansali, head of treasury and executive director at Finrex Treasury Advisors LLP, said. There is a host of data to be released on Monday which is otherwise a holiday, he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crude oil prices fell amid Trump threatening tariffs on countries purchasing oil and gas from Venezuela. Brent crude oil was up 0.05 per cent to $74.07 per barrel, while WTI crude was up 0.07 per cent at 69.97 per barrel as of 9:00 AM IST.&nbsp;&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Stocks to Watch, March 28: BSE, Infosys, UltraTech, BEL, Jindal Steel, BEML",

It is well known from precedents that an unduly high tax regime in any sector makes it evasion-prone,&rdquo; said Vivek Jalan, partner with Tax Connect Advisory Services.&nbsp;According to Saurabh Agarwal, partner with EY, hotels can opt for the specified-premises classification if the value at which it offers rooms doesn&rsquo;t exceed ₹7,500 in the previous financial year.",

Traditionally, credit underwriting has depended on documented financials and credit bureau scores. This approach fails to cover a large part of the market that is new-to-credit. It is estimated that more than 400 million adults in India are credit un-served and another 160 million are credit underserved.

    "body": "Fintechs in the country have grown in the last decade, both in the number of entities and scale. The key growth sectors have been payments, credit, insurance and wealth management, fuelled by angel investors, venture capital (VC) and private equity.However, in the last couple of years, the access to risk capital for fintechs has dropped considerably, with total funds raised in 2023 ($1.2 billion) being less than a quarter of what was raised in 2021 ($5.1 billion).

    "body": "It was not in response to the tariff war unleashed by American President Donald Trump that India reduced Customs duties on many items and withdrew the equalisation levy of 6 per cent, said Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday.&nbsp;Replying in the Rajya Sabha to the debate on the Finance Bill, 2025, and the Appropriation Bill for this year&rsquo;s Budget, Sitharaman said the government would continue to simplify Customs duties.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have been doing it since 2023. Steadily, every year newer items are being brought in, keeping in mind an &lsquo;Atmanirbhar Bharat&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s an ongoing process and has nothing to do with today&rsquo;s situation but a process which will continue even in the future,&rdquo; Sitharaman said.&nbsp;Later the Rajya Sabha passed the Finance Bill, 2025, and the Appropriation Bill of the Budget.&nbsp;On the equalisation levy, Sitharaman said: &ldquo;There were two types of equalisation levies &mdash; 6 per cent imposed in 2016 and 2 per cent imposed in 2020 &mdash; which was applicable before July 2024. The 2 per cent levy was removed in the July Budget (last year) after stakeholder consultations. And that was much before President Donald Trump took office.&rdquo;&nbsp;On amendments regarding pension regulations introduced in the Finance Bill, Sitharaman said those were only validating the existing rules and did not alter the existing pensions.&nbsp;&ldquo;The validation rules do not affect defence pensioners in any way because they are covered by separate rules. It is not an amendment to any pension rules or instructions but only a reaffirmation of the same w.e.f. June 1, 1972, ie the date the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules were promulgated,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp;Sitharaman said the Sixth Central Pay Commission made a distinction between those who retired before January 1, 2006, and those who did after that date.&nbsp;The Congress-led central government of the day had accepted the recommendations of the commission and decided there would be such a distinction. The Seventh Central Pay Commission brought parity between the two sets of pensioners.&nbsp;On cess and surcharge, Sitharaman said receipts were for meeting specific expenditures such as those on health, education, and transport.&nbsp;&ldquo;Contrary to the claims that the states do not benefit from cess and surcharges, these are ones spent for centrally sponsored schemes and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and National Food Security Act. These schemes are either predominantly or fully funded by the central government but implemented by the states. The mid-day meal is also funded by these cesses and those benefit the states. In six years &mdash; between 2019 and 2025 &mdash;cumulative utilisation has exceeded collection, with 105 per cent of the cess collected utilised. While ₹15.14 trillion was collected during this period, ₹15.97 trillion was utilised. So the central government doesn&rsquo;t sit with that money,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp;FM, US Chamber CEO discuss growing business tiesFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday met US Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Suzanne Clark in New Delhi. The Finance Ministry said in an X post that Sitharaman met Clark along with Atul Keshap, President of the US-India Business Council (USIBC). Clark praised India&rsquo;s economic reforms, particularly in FDI, which have driven increasing US business interest in India.  &nbsp;She also emphasized the growing cross-border investment, innovation, entrepreneurship, and trade, which continue to strengthen the US-India partnership.&nbsp;- PTI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",

Monetary easing may be limited to 75 bps in FY26,&quot; Ind-Ra Chief Economist and Head Public Finance, Devendra Kumar Pant said.However, if the impact of US reciprocal tariff turns out to be higher than expected, there may be higher easing by RBI, Ind-Ra said in a statement.The RBI&#39;s monetary policy committee is scheduled to meet 6 times in the next fiscal 2025-26 beginning April 1. The first meeting is slated for April 7-9.&quot;Ind-Ra expects the monetary policy committee (MPC) to opt in for a 25bps cut in policy rates in its forthcoming April 2025 meeting,&quot; the rating agency said.Higher and stubborn inflation had prompted the RBI to tighten the monetary policy, and it raised the policy rate by 250 bps between May 2022 and February 2023, reaching 6.5 per cent.In February 2025, the repo rate was cut by 25 bps to 6.25 per cent.Ind-Ra expects the headline retail inflation in March quarter of FY25 to fall below 4 per cent, after a gap of 21 quarters.It expects RBI to go in for maximum three rate cuts in FY26, aggregating to 75 bps.&quot;These along with one rate cut in February 2025 would translate in a 100bps cut in the current policy easing with the terminal repo rate at 5.5 per cent and average inflation at around 4 per cent, which would translate in a real repo rate of 1.5 per cent in FY26,&quot; Ind-Ra said.The February 2025 MPC minutes suggest that the RBI is cognizant of slowing growth momentum. This suggests that while the low and stable inflation is the prime target of the RBI, the growth support through monetary policy will increasingly be a focus area of monetary policy, Ind-Ra added.",

    "body": "Five years ago, on March 25, 2020, India came to a standstill as the first nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of Covid.&nbsp;The pandemic was an undeniable stress test for healthcare systems across the globe, exposing weaknesses and forcing nations to rethink their preparedness.&nbsp;Five years later, it is time to assess whether India is better prepared for another public health crisis.&nbsp;The Covid outbreak initially exposed India&rsquo;s healthcare vulnerabilities. Hospitals were overwhelmed, oxygen shortages turned deadly, and an overburdened workforce struggled to keep pace. However, the system geared up to the challenges later, particularly with its vaccination programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years that followed, government spending on healthcare has remained abysmally low.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) rose from 1.2 per cent in 2019-20 to 1.5 per cent in 2021-22, only to fall again to 1.3 per cent in 2022-23.&nbsp;!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}}))}();&nbsp;This modest increase was largely driven by state governments, whose healthcare spending rose from 0.9 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 1.1 per cent in 2020-21, a level that has been maintained until 2024-25.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the national level, the Union government&rsquo;s allocation to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has steadily declined from 0.32 per cent of GDP to just 0.28 per cent.&nbsp;By comparison, most developed nations allocate between 6 and 10 per cent of GDP to healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Health Policy 2017 envisaged increasing health spending at least 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2025 &mdash; a target that was initially set for 2022.&nbsp;However, with healthcare spending stagnating, India has fallen short of its targets and is unlikely to meet the 2025 goal without a drastic increase in investment. This under funding threatens to derail any progress made in fortifying healthcare infrastructure.&nbsp;The shortage of healthcare professionals is another pressing concern. In 2020, India had just 0.7 doctors per 1,000 people. That figure has only marginally increased to 0.79 in 2024, still well below the global average of 1.6-2.5. Countries like Germany and Japan boast over four doctors per 1,000 people.&nbsp;&nbsp;!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}}))}();&nbsp;One of the clearest indicators of India&rsquo;s lagging preparedness is hospital bed availability. According to World Bank estimates, India had 1.6 hospital beds per 1,000 people in 2021, a decline from 1.7 in 2014. In contrast, China has expanded its capacity significantly, reaching five beds per 1,000 people by 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;About two decades ago, in 2005, India and China were comparable at 1.9 beds per 1,000 people. However, China has since made significant progress, while India has seen a decline in its hospital bed density.&nbsp;India has, however, recorded a decline in out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) &mdash; expenses directly paid by households at the point of receiving healthcare. According to National Health Accounts estimates for 2021-22, OOPE fell to 39.4 per cent of total health expenditure (THE) from 48.8 per cent in 2017-18.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this improvement, India&rsquo;s OOPE remains significantly higher than global standards. For instance, in many European nations, OOPE accounts for less than 20 per cent of the total healthcare spending.&nbsp;Countries with robust universal healthcare systems, such as the UK and Canada, have figures below 15 per cent. Expansion of the government&#39;s flagship health scheme &mdash; Ayushman Bharat &mdash; to those above 70 years may have reduced OOPE further.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessons of the last pandemic have prompted discussions on the need for sustained healthcare investments. As global trends indicate an increasing emphasis on health spending, India&#39;s capacity to bolster its healthcare system will be crucial in determining its readiness for future public health challenges.",

    "body": "By Ruchi Bhatia and Subhadip Sircar&nbsp;India&rsquo;s new central bank governor has marked his first 100 days in office with a growth-friendly approach to monetary policy, suggesting he&rsquo;ll be willing to cut interest rates further and keep liquidity flush as the economy braces for trade turmoil.&nbsp;Since taking office in December, Sanjay Malhotra has reduced interest rates for the first time in five years, injected nearly $60 billion into the banking system, allowed the rupee to slide, and eased restrictions on bank lending. That&rsquo;s a departure from the hawkish stance of his predecessor, Shaktikanta Das, who kept interest rates unchanged for more than two years to curb inflation, an approach that the government said was partly to blame for the economy&rsquo;s unexpected weakness last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Regulations should safeguard, not stifle: RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra&nbsp;Officials in New Delhi say a slowdown in inflation is giving Malhotra more room to cut rates now, which makes sense to do given rising global trade tensions. The government wants the Reserve Bank of India to loosen policy since economic conditions remain challenging, with credit growth worsening due to tight liquidity, the officials said, asking not to be identified in order to discuss internal matters.&nbsp;While officials haven&rsquo;t given any explicit instructions to the RBI, they said bank executives met with the monetary authority in the past two months and raised concerns about their dwindling ability to lend, according to the people.&nbsp;Supportive fiscal steps and an accommodative monetary policy will help make the economy resilient amid significant global uncertainties, the Finance Ministry said in its monthly economic review on Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;Malhotra, a former top official in the Finance Ministry, has clearly flagged his intention to boost the economy. &ldquo;There is a need to preserve the high growth momentum, while maintaining price stability, necessitating monetary policy to use various policy instruments to maintain the inflation-growth balance,&rdquo; he said at the first monetary policy meeting he chaired in February, according to the minutes.&nbsp;The new governor has also pushed back on proposed rules that would require banks to hold more liquid assets, and lowered risk weights for bank lending to non-bank finance firms, two measures that would help spur credit growth.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;RBI allows standalone primary dealers to participate in all repo operations&nbsp;Concerns about a slowing economy is underpinning that approach. Growth probably slowed to 6.5 per cent in the fiscal year through March, the least since the global pandemic, according to statistics ministry forecasts. The government expects growth of 6.3 per cent to 6.8 per cent for the year starting April, though that&rsquo;s still short of the 8 per cent it says is needed to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s goal of making India a developed country by 2047.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of market watchers anticipate further easing measures from the RBI, which would align with the government&rsquo;s desire to revive growth.&nbsp;&ldquo;While the RBI&rsquo;s new governor has been quiet on his policy preferences, it&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s keen to revive the Indian economy to exceed 6.5 per cent growth through a package of rate cuts, liquidity injections and regulatory easing,&rdquo; said Samsara Wang, Asia sovereign debt analyst at PineBridge Investments Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. &ldquo;Bottom line, monetary policy is going to be more supportive of growth and more balanced on banking regulation.&rdquo;&nbsp;Economists are adding to their bets on rate cuts this year, with those at Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG flagging the possibility the central bank will change its policy stance to accommodative at its next meeting on April 9.&nbsp; ALSO READ |&nbsp;Swap market prices in more RBI rate cuts amid weak growth, low inflation&nbsp;Among possible further steps to boost growth, the RBI will need to inject Rs 2 trillion ($23.3 billion) of cash into the financial market via tools such as bond purchases and foreign-exchange swaps in the financial year starting April, according to IDFC FIRST Bank Ltd.&nbsp;The 10-year yield fell to a fresh three-year low to 6.58 per cent on Thursday.&nbsp;Maintaining Stability&nbsp;From the RBI&rsquo;s perspective, Malhotra hasn&rsquo;t differed from the central bank&rsquo;s stated mandate to maintain price stability, while keeping growth objectives in mind, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Irrespective of who is in charge, the central bank&rsquo;s core philosophy doesn&rsquo;t change, the person said.&nbsp;&nbsp;The RBI and Ministry of Finance didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to requests to comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors are positioning for further policy easing. Global funds such as PineBridge are looking to add to their India bond positions, while Brandywine Global Investment Management is long Indian bonds via supranational ones, saying local yields are expected to fall. Overseas funds have bought a net $5.9 billion of rupee-denominated debt this year even as they offloaded $14.7 billion of equities.&nbsp;&ldquo;We believe that the policy stance of the government and RBI are clearly veering towards stimulating growth and consumption demand,&rdquo; said Jalpan Shah, head of fixed income at Trust Mutual Fund in Mumbai. &ldquo;These steps seem positive for growth, both for the bond market and risk assets like equities.&rdquo;&nbsp;",

    "body": "Geopolitical tensions, trade policy uncertainties, volatility in international commodity prices and financial market uncertainties pose considerable risks to India&rsquo;s economic growth in the coming year, the finance ministry cautioned on Wednesday.&nbsp;&ldquo;Global trade continues to be affected by uncertainty in the policy environment... tariff-related developments in multiple countries have heightened trade-related risks, affecting investment and trade flows globally. Consequently, India&rsquo;s exports have recorded softer growth thus far in FY25. However, a robust services trade surplus continues to offset the impact of lower growth in merchandise exports,&rdquo; the finance ministry said in its latest Monthly Economic Review.&nbsp;The finance ministry&rsquo;s comments come in the view of an escalating tariff war unleashed by US President Donald Trump as part of his &lsquo;America First&rsquo; policy. Trump has promised to launch reciprocal tariffs on trading partners on April 2.&nbsp;In the latest review, the finance ministry said India should remain cautious and avoid importing widespread cynicism and pessimism prevalent in other countries. &ldquo;If the private sector was to invest in the economy, banking on the resilience of the Indian economy and its steady growth outlook, it would overpower the risks to the growth outlook considerably,&rdquo; the review said.&nbsp;The finance ministry has stressed that the industry must recognise the &ldquo;mutual endogeneity&rdquo; of its investment spending and consumption demand. It expects that the changes in the personal income-tax structure are expected to improve the disposable incomes of the middle class and their consumption.&nbsp;Estimates of agricultural production suggest a positive outlook for food inflation, the ministry said.&nbsp;Retail inflation eased to 3.6 per cent in February 2025 on the back of the recent benign price trends of food items, the review said.&nbsp;India is expected to achieve a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 6.5 per cent in FY25, according to the finance ministry&rsquo;s estimates.&nbsp;GDP growth for the economy was 5.6 per cent in the second quarter of this financial year, followed by a pick up in the following quarter to 6.2 per cent.&nbsp;&ldquo;One offsetting positive is the outlook for commodity prices. Domestic private sector capital formation, focused on India&rsquo;s solid fundamentals and economic prospects, will be an important driver of economic growth in FY26,&rdquo; it said.&nbsp;The review added that this performance was driven by strong agricultural and service sector performance on the supply side and a steady increase in consumption and core merchandise and services exports on the demand side.&nbsp;On fiscal deficit and other parameters, the finance ministry&rsquo;s review said there is a close convergence of actual deficits, critical ratios, and essential expenditures with their Budget estimates, according to the data available for FY25, indicating a sustained commitment to fiscal targets.&nbsp;The Union Budget 2025-26 announced a debt consolidation path projecting the Union government debt to decline by at least 5.1 percentage points over a six-year period from 2024-25 to 2030-31.&nbsp;Noting that the current labour market conditions are stable, the monthly review added that many employment outlook surveys indicate a sense of optimism and an increased willingness to engage in hiring practices in the upcoming quarter.&nbsp;",

Those aged between 36 and 40 years, and above 61 years, expressed the strongest interest. The preferred destinations included the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with its Golden Visa scheme being particularly attractive, it said.&nbsp;The report highlighted residency-through-investment programmes, or Golden Visas, as a key enabler.&nbsp;Popular options include the US EB-5 Visa, Portugal&rsquo;s Golden Visa, and Canada&rsquo;s Start-up Visa. The UAE&rsquo;s Golden Visa stands out among Indian UHNWIs, offering residency, tax benefits, a thriving property market, and proximity to India, making it both practical and appealing.&nbsp;Gautami Gavankar, president Kotak Mahindra Bank, emphasised that this migration trend did not signal a capital flight. Indian residents are limited to remitting $250,000 annually, while NRIs can remit up to $1 million per year.&nbsp;The report also revealed UHNWIs&rsquo; aggressive investment approach, with portfolios prioritising domestic and global equity markets, followed by commercial real estate, debt, and alternative investments. Increasingly, these individuals are looking beyond India for smart, practical opportunities, driven by a favourable business climate, tax advantages, and portfolio diversification. As their wealth grows and spending shifts to dollars, investing in dollar-based assets becomes critical.&nbsp;As of 2023, India had 283,000 UHNWIs, each having a net worth of over ₹25 crore, with a combined wealth of ₹232 trillion.

    "body": "The central government is pushing for policy reforms specific to the unique problems and demands of various segments of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) without viewing them as a homogeneous sector, Subhas Chandra Lal Das, secretary of the MSME ministry, said on Wednesday.&nbsp;&ldquo;MSMEs is a nomenclature. It is not a sector. We need a differentiated approach. While we have 60 million digitally registered MSMEs, only 800,000 of these are small, and just about 70,000 are medium. There are varying levels of capability and digital maturity, exposure to debt, and technology adoption. I request the industry to focus more on the SME segment,&rdquo; Das said at a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) event in New Delhi.&nbsp;The government can provide a push factor with a universal digitalisation programme &mdash; a broad enabler &mdash; but SMEs and the industry need to work on the &lsquo;pull factor&rsquo;, Das said.&nbsp;The government is working on a digitalisation road map for SMEs, with the MSME ministry and NITI Aayog developing the plan.&nbsp;&ldquo;Strategically, the new classification scheme gives the small sector a big headroom deliberately to provide the necessary stimulus and growth space for exports, technology, and advancing towards high-tech,&rdquo; Das said. In parallel, a different approach &mdash; more rooted in industry and academia and less in the government &mdash; is required for the medium sector, he added.&nbsp;The government&rsquo;s effort is to create upward mobility in technology, skilling, and business growth so that more micro enterprises can become small, transition into medium, and then grow into large companies.&nbsp;According to officials, the Centre has been working on a plan to provide customised schemes for medium enterprises to shed their inhibitions about becoming large companies.&nbsp;Moreover, the central government is working on a national mission to remove regulations that prevent India&rsquo;s MSMEs from expanding into large companies and stifling their ambitions, NITI Aayog Chief Executive Officer (CEO) B V R Subrahmanyam said at the same event.&nbsp;&ldquo;MSMEs are most affected by regulation. Big companies can hire consultants or accounting firms for solutions, but MSMEs get crushed under the weight of regulation. The prime minister has taken a major step in deregulation &mdash; there&rsquo;s a massive task force under the cabinet secretary working rapidly to ensure deregulation of land, electricity, water, and other such issues facing MSMEs,&rdquo; Subrahmanyam said.&nbsp;The Aayog, Subrahmanyam said, is also working on a programme to develop a competitive ecosystem for intermediate goods (goods used to manufacture other goods).&nbsp;The CEO said the biggest problem facing MSMEs is the adoption of technology. To address this, Subrahmanyam launched the Digital Excellence for Growth and Enterprise, or Dx-EDGE, a platform to equip MSMEs with the tools, knowledge, and ecosystem needed to become future-ready, competitive, and resilient.&nbsp;The platform is being spearheaded by CII, along with the NITI Frontier Tech Hub and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). The Frontier Tech Hub was launched earlier this month to keep India competitive in the global technology race.&nbsp;&ldquo;If an individual entrepreneur needs to use technology to increase production, the local university will act as a mentor and upskill them&hellip; There are 60 million MSMEs &mdash; there&rsquo;s no way the government or even CII can reach all of them,&rdquo; the CEO said.&nbsp;The Dx-EDGE programme will also help students in engineering and technical institutes gain real-world experience in helping companies improve their technology adoption, he added.&nbsp;On developing a competent MSME ecosystem, citing the Japanese MSME economy, Subrahmanyam said most large Japanese companies have significant vendor development systems in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "body": "The Chhattisgarh government has received investment proposals worth ₹3,700 crore from industries in Karnataka as the state tries to allay fears of Naxalite disturbances and present itself as an attractive investment destination.&nbsp;Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai engaged with top industrialists and business leaders in Bengaluru on Wednesday as part of a roadshow to explore investment opportunities in information technology (IT), information technology-enabled services (ITeS), textiles, electronics, food processing, and green fuel sectors.&nbsp;Sai has earlier visited New Delhi and Mumbai as part of his attempt to add to the state&rsquo;s economy of existing heavy industries such as iron and steel to IT and a greater number of small and medium industries.&nbsp;About 16 per cent of the country&rsquo;s steel and 15 per cent of aluminium is produced in the state.&nbsp;Speaking to industrialists, the chief minister said: &ldquo;We are developing Nava Raipur as the largest IT hub in central India. An investment of $1.6 billion has been made here, which will make the infrastructure here at par with the best cities in the country.&rdquo;&nbsp;Representatives from companies such as BEML, Gokaldas Exports, and Britannia praised the state&rsquo;s business-friendly policies and infrastructure support.&nbsp;Sai said that under the government&rsquo;s new industrial policy, special provisions have been made for large industries, offering a 30-50 per cent return on capital investment (₹200 to ₹450 crore).&nbsp;Special concessions have been announced for electrical and electronics, pharmaceuticals, textile, food, and agro processing sectors. The state is also setting up a pharmaceutical park in Nava Raipur which will be the largest pharmaceutical park in central India.&nbsp;The new industrial policy has led to investment proposals worth ₹1 trillion from Raipur, New Delhi, and Mumbai, the state government said last month.&nbsp;The state has designated Bastar and Surguja as &ldquo;highest-priority regions&rdquo; for industrial investment promotion. To encourage growth in these areas, incentives in certain sectors, as well as discounts ranging from 50-100 per cent on iron and coal royalties, have been introduced. Additionally, there is a provision for reimbursement of cess up to 150 per cent.&nbsp;The chief minister further said that there is a greater focus on building infrastructure. Chhattisgarh has great connectivity, with expressways to Ranchi, Visakhapatnam, and Hyderabad being built and nearly complete. The state also has excellent rail, road, and air connections and in terms of power generation, is one of the leading states of the country,&rdquo; he added.",

    "body": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday that the Trump administration would boost military ties with the Philippines to strengthen deterrence against threats from the communist Chinese and ensure freedom of navigation in the disputed South China Sea.Hegseth spoke during a meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the Philippines, his first stop in his first trip to Asia to reaffirm Washington&#39;s ironclad commitment to the region under Trump. Ahead of the visit, China called the United States a predator and an unreliable ally.Trump&#39;s America First foreign policy thrust has triggered concerns in Asia about the scale and depth of US commitment to the region.Hegseth&#39;s decision to make the Philippines his first stop in Asia, followed by Japan both US treaty allies facing territorial disputes with China was the strongest assurance yet by the US under Trump to maintain a security presence in the region.Deterrence is necessary around the world but specifically in this region, in your country, considering the threats from the communist Chinese, Hegseth told Marcos. Friends need to stand shoulder to shoulder to deter conflict, to ensure that there is free navigation whether you call it the South China Sea or the West Philippine Sea.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;6 intelligence leaks that shook the US: Latest Yemen breach joins the list&quot;Peace through strength is a very real thing, Hegseth said. He praised the Philippines for standing very firm to defend its interests in the contested waters.China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, a major security and global trade route. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims to the resource-rich and busy waters, but confrontations have spiked between Chinese and Philippine coast guard and naval forces in the last two years.Chinese forces have used powerful water cannons and dangerous maneuvers in the high seas to block what Beijing said were encroachments by Philippine ships into China&#39;s waters. Chinese military aircraft have also approached Philippine patrol planes at alarmingly close distance to drive them away from the Scarborough Shoal, a hotly disputed fishing atoll in the disputed waterway.Under the previous Biden administration, the US has repeatedly warned that it is obligated to help defend the Philippines if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea.Hegseth echoed that pledge by expressing the ironclad commitment of Trump and him to the Mutual Defence Treaty and to the partnership.&quot;&nbsp; Marcos told the US defense chief that by visiting the Philippines first in Asia he sends a very strong message of the commitment of both our countries to continue to work together to maintain the peace in the Indo-Pacific region, within the South China Sea.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;We have always understood the principle that the greatest force for peace in this part of the world would be the United States, Marcos said.Ahead of Hegseth&#39;s visit, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said China opposes interference from outside countries in the South China Sea.&quot;US-Philippines military cooperation must not harm the security interests of other countries or undermine regional peace and stability, he said Thursday in a monthly news conference.He added without elaborating that the United States has an astonishing record of breaking its promises and abandoning its allies throughout its history.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun separately warned the Philippines in a news conference on Tuesday that nothing good could come out of opening the door to a predator. Those who willingly serve as chess pieces will be deserted in the end.&quot;&nbsp; Hegseth&#39;s visit to the Philippines comes a month before the longtime treaty allies hold the Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder to shoulder, their largest annual combat exercises that include live-fire drills. Tn recent years, the exercises have been held near the South China Sea and the sea border between the Philippines and Taiwan.The defense secretary projected composure and camaraderie, as he&#39;s receiving harsh criticism for texting attack plans to a Signal group that included top-level US security officials and the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine.Clad in a sweatshirt and shorts, he joined American and Filipino forces in physical training, including push-ups, in a gym. He shook hands and posed smiling with military personnel while they flashed the thumbs-up in pictures posted by the US Embassy on X.",

    "body": "Billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal is preparing to leave the United Kingdom after nearly three decades. This follows the UK government&rsquo;s decision to abolish its non-domiciled (non-dom) tax status, according to a report by The Financial Times.&nbsp;The Indian-born industrialist, who built ArcelorMittal into the world&rsquo;s second-largest steel producer, is likely to give up his UK tax residency before the new rules take effect in April 2025. While his final decision remains pending, news report suggests that destinations such as Dubai, Switzerland, and Italy &ndash; all of which offer attractive tax incentives for high-net-worth individuals &ndash; are under consideration.&nbsp;His decision comes in response to the Labour party&rsquo;s crackdown on non-domiciled residents, which will require wealthy individuals to pay UK taxes on their global income and assets. The move has already prompted an exodus of wealthy individuals from the UK.&nbsp;What is UK&rsquo;s non-dom tax regime?UK&rsquo;s non-domiciled tax status allowed foreign-born residents to avoid paying British taxes on overseas earnings unless they transferred those funds to a UK account. The new system, championed by Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves, will introduce a residence-based tax policy and bring foreign income under the UK inheritance tax framework. The government claims the reform will generate &pound;2.7 billion annually by 2028-29, arguing that it will ensure a fairer tax system.&nbsp;However, critics have warned that the policy could have the opposite effect, leading to a flight of capital and investment from the UK. Many of Britain&rsquo;s wealthiest residents, including business leaders and investors, have already begun shifting their base to countries with lower tax rates.&nbsp;Mittal&rsquo;s businesses and net worthMittal moved to the UK in 1995. His company, ArcelorMittal, played a key role in shaping the global steel industry. He stepped down as CEO in 2021, handing over the reins to his son, Aditya Mittal, while retaining his role as executive chairman.&nbsp;Mittal&rsquo;s fortune is estimated at &pound;14.9 billion and has a net worth of $18.5 billion, according to Forbes. He ranked seventh UK&rsquo;s Sunday Times Rich List last year. Mittal owns multiple properties across the world, including a luxury chalet in St Moritz, Switzerland, and real estate holdings in the US and Asia. In London, he owns a mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens, purchased in 2004 for &pound;67 million from former Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone. His departure could mark a significant exit of Britain&rsquo;s wealthiest entrepreneurs.&nbsp;",

    "title": "Why does Trump want US to control Greenland? Location, resources and more",
    "body": "US Vice President JD Vance&#39;s trip to Greenland on Friday comes at a time when President Donald Trump is insisting that Washington should take over the semi-autonomous Danish territory.Why does Trump want Greenland?Greenland&#39;s strategic location and resources could benefit the US It lies along the shortest route from Europe to North America, vital for the US ballistic missile warning system.&nbsp;The US has expressed interest in expanding its existing military presence on the island, including placing radars there to monitor the waters between the island, Iceland and Britain, which are a gateway for Russian navy vessels and nuclear submarines.&nbsp;On Wednesday, Trump reiterated his desire to take over the island, saying the US would go as far as needed to take it.&nbsp;The island, whose capital Nuuk is closer to New York than the Danish capital Copenhagen, boasts mineral, oil and natural gas wealth, but development has been slow and the mining sector has seen very limited US investment. Mining companies operating in Greenland are mostly Australian, Canadian or British.&nbsp;A White House official has said Greenland has ample supply of rare earth minerals that would power the next generation of the US economy.What is the current US presence?The US military maintains a permanent presence at the Pituffik air base in Greenland&#39;s northwest.&nbsp;A 1951 agreement between the United States and Denmark gave the US the right to move around freely and construct military bases in Greenland as long as Denmark and Greenland are notified.&nbsp;Historically, Denmark has accommodated the US because Copenhagen does not have the capability to defend Greenland, and because of US security guarantees to Denmark through NATO, according to Kristian Soeby Kristensen, senior researcher at Copenhagen University&#39;s Centre for Military Studies.What is Greenland&#39;s status now?The island, a former colony of Denmark, became a formal territory of the Nordic kingdom in 1953 and is subject to the Danish constitution.&nbsp;In 2009, the island was granted broad self-governing autonomy, including the right to declare independence from Denmark through a referendum.&nbsp;Under the 2009 law, Greenland&#39;s parliament, Inatsisartut, can invoke a provision that would have Denmark and Greenland begin negotiations about achieving full independence.&nbsp;The people of Greenland would need to endorse independence through a referendum, and an independence agreement between Denmark and Greenland would also require consent from the Danish parliament.&nbsp;Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of the pro-business Democrats, which came first in an election on March 11, has said he is seeking a broad coalition government to show unity in the face of the US drive to control the island.&nbsp;The party favours gradual independence from Denmark.What does Greenland want?Relations between Greenland and Denmark have been strained after revelations of historical mistreatment of Greenlanders under colonial rule. However, Trump&#39;s interest in making the island part of the US has prompted Denmark to accelerate work to improve ties with Greenland.&nbsp;Opinion polls show a majority of Greenland&#39;s 57,000 inhabitants support independence, but they are divided over the timing and potential impact on living standards.&nbsp;Many Greenlanders warn against acting rashly - fearing Greenland could become worse off and expose itself to the USif it too quickly seeks independence from Denmark. Most Greenlanders do not want a new colonial master.&nbsp;Greenland&#39;s economy has been reliant on fishing, which accounts for over 95% of exports, and annual subsidies from Denmark, which cover roughly half of the public budget.&nbsp;In total, Denmark spends just under $1 billion each year on Greenland, or $17,500 for each inhabitant.&nbsp;Since 2019 Greenlandic politicians have repeatedly said they are interested in strengthening cooperation and trade with the US.&nbsp;However, outgoing Prime Minister Mute Egede has stressed the island is not for sale and that only its people should decide their future.What if Greenland becomes independent?If Greenland became independent, it could choose to become associated with the US without becoming US territory.&nbsp;The island could form a so-called &quot;free association&quot; with the US that would replace Danish subsidies with US support and protection in return for military rights, a set-up similar to the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau.&nbsp;According to Ulrik Pram Gad, senior researcher and expert on Greenland, Trump&#39;s idea of buying Greenland is based on a misunderstanding of international law and the principle of self-determination, which gives people the right to choose their own political status.What does Denmark say?When Trump offered to buy the island during his first presidential term, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called it &quot;absurd&quot;.&nbsp;Since Trump expressed renewed interest, Frederiksen has said Denmark wishes to cooperate closely with the US while stressing Greenland should determine its own future.&nbsp;Frederiksen said on Tuesday the US was putting &quot;unacceptable pressure&quot; on Greenland with this week&#39;s visit and that Denmark would resist such pressure.&nbsp;(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)&nbsp;",

    "body": "A casual conversation among top US officials in a private messaging group turned into one of the most damaging intelligence leaks in recent history. It exposed US military strategies, weapon shipments, and covert operations against Houthi militia in Yemen, sending shockwaves through the defence and intelligence community.&nbsp;How the leak happened&nbsp;Senior officials from the Trump administration mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, to a private Signal group chat. Unbeknownst to them, Goldberg gained real-time access to classified military discussions. Seizing the moment, he later published the details, bringing sensitive US military plans into the public domain.&nbsp;Now dubbed the Yemen War Plan Leak, this breach ranks among the most significant intelligence failures in US history, joining the likes of the Pentagon Papers, Edward Snowden&rsquo;s NSA revelations, and WikiLeaks disclosures.&nbsp;Here are six major intelligence leaks in US history:&nbsp;The Hutchinson letters (1772)&nbsp;Before the US won independence, Benjamin Franklin leaked letters from Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson, which revealed the governor&rsquo;s push for a stronger British military presence in American colonies. This revelation fuelled growing revolutionary sentiments and deepened public distrust in colonial leadership.&nbsp;The Pentagon papers (1971)&nbsp;Daniel Ellsberg, a military analyst at the RAND Corporation, leaked a top-secret government report showing how US officials had misled the public about the Vietnam War. Published by The New York Times, the Pentagon Papers exposed decades of deception. Although Ellsberg faced espionage charges, the case was dismissed in 1973. He is now regarded as a pivotal figure in the history of government transparency.&nbsp;WikiLeaks documents (2010)&nbsp;US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning leaked thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks, revealing shocking details of civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan, and human rights violations. Among the most infamous disclosures was a classified video showing a US Apache helicopter attacking and killing 12 civilians, including two Reuters journalists. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison but was later pardoned by former US President Barack Obama in 2017 after serving seven years.&nbsp;NSA leaks (2013)&nbsp;Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed the US government&rsquo;s vast surveillance programs, revealing that intelligence agencies were secretly collecting citizens&rsquo; phone data on a global scale. His leaks, published by The Guardian and The Washington Post, triggered worldwide debates on privacy and government overreach. Charged with espionage, Snowden fled to Russia, where he remains in exile, advocating for digital privacy rights and press freedom.&nbsp;Russia election leak (2017)&nbsp;National Security Agency (NSA) translator Reality Winner leaked a classified intelligence report detailing Russian interference in the 2016 US election. She shared the document with The Intercept, believing that the public deserved to know the truth. Investigators quickly traced the leak back to her, leading to her arrest and a prison sentence of more than four years. Her story later inspired the 2023 film Reality, starring Sydney Sweeney, which closely follows the real FBI interrogation transcript from her arrest.&nbsp;Watergate scandal (1972-1974)&nbsp;Though not a conventional intelligence leak, the Watergate scandal remains one of the most infamous US government cover-ups in history. Investigative journalists exposed illegal activities, including the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and subsequent cover-ups by former President Richard Nixon&rsquo;s administration. The relentless reporting ultimately led to Nixon&rsquo;s resignation.",

    "body": "US Vice President JD Vance and his wife are due to visit an American military base in Greenland on Friday in a trip that was scaled back after an uproar by Greenlanders and Danes who were irked that the original itinerary was planned without consulting them.The couple&#39;s revised trip to the semi-autonomous Danish territory comes as relations between the US and the Nordic country have soured after US President Donald Trump repeatedly suggested that the United States should in some form control the mineral-rich territory of Denmark a traditional US ally and Nato member.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Greenland forms new govt on eve of Vance visit to resist US annexation bidFriday&#39;s one-day visit to the US Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. It will also reduce the likelihood that the Vance and his wife will cross paths with residents angered by Trump&#39;s annexation announcements.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Tuesday that the visit, which was originally set for three days, created unacceptable pressure.&quot; On Thursday she was cited by Danish public broadcaster DR as saying: We really want to work with the Americans on defense and security in the kingdom. But Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.Initially, Usha Vance had announced a solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut. Her husband then subsequently said he would join her on that trip, only to change that itinerary again after protests from Greenland and Denmark to a one-day visit of the couple to the military post only.Nonetheless, in an interview on Wednesday, Trump repeated his desire for US control of Greenland. Asked if the people there were eager to become US citizens, Trump said he didn&#39;t know but I think we have to do it, and we have to convince them.As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.During his first term, Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world&#39;s largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn&#39;t for sale. The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Trump&#39;s plans.Vance has several times criticized long-standing European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonising partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the US.In the meantime, opponents of Trump&#39;s plans to control Greenland, announced a rally in front of the American embassy in the Danish capital for Saturday, DR reported Thursday.The protesters were planning to speak out against American pressure against Greenland and Denmark and unwanted visits from the US government, DR reported.",

    "title": "US colleges face funding cuts as Trump ties aid to policy compliance",
    "body": "After decades of partnership with the US government, colleges are facing new doubts about the future of their federal funding.President Donald Trump&#39;s administration has been using the funding spigot to seek compliance with his agenda, cutting off money to schools including Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania. All the while, universities across the country are navigating cuts to grants for research institutions.The squeeze on higher education underscores how much American colleges depend on the federal government a provider of grants and contracts that have amounted to close to half the total revenue of some research universities, according to an Associated Press analysis.It adds up to a crisis for universities, and a problem for the country as a whole, say school administrators and advocates for academic freedom. America&#39;s scientific and medical research capabilities are tightly entwined with its universities as part of a compact that started after World War II to develop national expertise and knowledge.It feels like any day, any university could step out of line in some way and then have all of their funding pulled, said Jonathan Friedman, managing director of free expression programs at PEN America.Tens of billions of dollars are at stakeThe AP analysis looked at federal funding for nearly 100 colleges currently under investigation for programs the administration has deemed as illegally pushing diversity, equity and inclusion, or for not doing enough to combat antisemitism. Those schools took in over $33 billion in federal revenue in the 2022-2023 academic year. That&#39;s before taking into account federal student aid, which represents billions more in tuition and room-and-board payments.For most of the schools, around 10 per cent to 13 per cent of their revenue came from federal contracts or research funding, according to the analysis. For some prestigious research universities, however, federal money represented up to half of their revenue.The AP analyzed data from the National Centre for Education Statistics and federal audit reports, with help from researchers Jason Cohn and James Carter at the Urban Institute.Perhaps no school is more vulnerable than Johns Hopkins University, which received $4 billion in federal funds, close to 40 per cent of its revenue, according to the analysis. Much of that went to defense research, paying for projects like missile design, submarine technology and precision tracking systems in outer space. Billions of dollars also went to medical research for topics such as immunology and transplants, aging, neuroscience and mental health.Johns Hopkins is facing an antisemitism investigation, which threatens its federal money, but already it has been feeling the effects of cuts to research grants from the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies. Earlier this month, it announced 2,200 layoffs.We face challenging times for the patients and families that rely on us for cures and treatments, and for the researchers dedicated to the pursuit of improving the health of all Americans, the university said in a statement.Trump extracted concessions from ColumbiaTrump has singled out Columbia University, making an example of the Ivy League school by withholding $400 million in federal money. The administration repeatedly accused Columbia of letting antisemitism go unchecked at protests against Israel that began at the New York City university last spring and quickly spread to other campuses a characterization disputed by those involved in the demonstrations.As a precondition for restoring that money along with billions more in future grants the Republican administration demanded unprecedented changes in university policy. Columbia&#39;s decision last week to bow to those demands, in part to salvage ongoing research projects at its labs and medical centre, has been criticised by some faculty and free speech groups as capitulating to an intrusion on academic freedom.At the White House on Wednesday, Trump expressed satisfaction with the pressure campaign on colleges.You see what we&#39;re doing with the colleges, and they&#39;re all bending and saying, Sir, thank you very much, we appreciate it,&#39; Trump said during an event for Women&#39;s History Month.In the 2022-2023 academic year, Columbia got close to a fifth of its revenue from federal sources, around $1.2 billion. An audit shows that much of Columbia&#39;s federal money went to research and development, including $166 million for global AIDS programmes, $99 million to study aging, $28 million for cancer biology and $24 million for drug abuse and addiction research.A new approach on enforcement of civil rights lawsFederal law allows the Education Department to terminate funding to colleges that violate civil rights laws, but only after taking certain steps. Title VI of the law says the department must first make a formal finding of noncompliance, offer a hearing, notify Congress and then wait 30 days before pulling aid.But the Trump administration has a new strategy, moving quickly from demands to penalties with little room for negotiating, and little indication of due process, legal experts say.At Penn, the administration suspended $175 million in federal funding from the Defense Department and the Department of Health and Human Services over a transgender swimmer who last competed for the school in 2022. The White House said the action came out of a review of discretionary money going to universities.It looks like much of the playbook is intimidation, more so than actual substantiated legal findings, said Michael Pillera, director of educational equity issues at the Lawyers&#39; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. I think all of this is designed as an attempt to intimidate all universities, not just the institutions under investigation.The cuts and the uncertainty have led some universities to accept fewer graduate students, cutting off pathways to careers. Many graduate students in science programs receive scholarships and stipends that come from federal research grants.Purdue University senior Alyssa Johnson had been planning to pursue graduate research on amphibian diseases, and she was accepted into a program. But she ultimately decided to change her course of study because of the uncertainty around funding.I kind of went through a little bit of career crisis, which was definitely catalyzed by what&#39;s going on with the current administration and their attitudes toward science and science communication, Johnson said.",

    "title": "Decades of AIDS vax research imperiled by Trump's withdrawal of US funding",
    "body": "By Jason Gale, Ashleigh Furlong and Janice Kew&nbsp;After decades of failed attempts, scientists were optimistic that a new generation of HIV vaccine candidates would finally succeed &mdash; changing the course of a pandemic that&rsquo;s claimed more than 42 million lives since 1981. But that hope is now dimming as the US moves to pull vital funding.&nbsp;A leaked document detailing the fate of more than 6,200 USAID programmes lists two leading HIV vaccine efforts among 5,341 projects earmarked for termination. The 281-page file, reviewed by Bloomberg News and first reported by The New York Times, outlines the Trump administration&rsquo;s plan to cut almost $28 billion in support for a wide range of global health initiatives &mdash; including Gavi, the vaccine alliance that immunizes hundreds of millions of children against deadly diseases such as measles and malaria.&nbsp;&ldquo;The speed, scale and inhumanity of this administration&rsquo;s approach to dismantling health programmes is staggering,&rdquo; said Mitchell Warren, the executive director of AVAC, a New York-based organization that advocates for HIV prevention research. &ldquo;The targeted disruption of HIV vaccine development is particularly perverse &mdash; it&rsquo;s undoing decades of progress.&rdquo;&nbsp;The largest HIV vaccine programme on the chopping block is a long-running effort led by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, IAVI, which had been promised more than $319 million in US support dating back to 2016. While nearly $238 million had already been disbursed, IAVI said it had expected an additional $22 million through mid-2026. A stop-work order last month forced the organization to wind down operations and lay off staff.&nbsp;Another major casualty is a $45 million award to the South African Medical Research Council, intended to fund HIV vaccine trials across multiple countries. Only about $9 million of that funding will ultimately be received.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We think it would be a tragedy not to continue the work,&rdquo; said Glenda Gray, the council&rsquo;s chief scientific officer. Researchers had proposed scaling back the study to include only South Africa &mdash; excluding Kenya and Uganda &mdash; in hopes of making it &ldquo;more attractive to funders,&rdquo; she said in an interview.&nbsp;With USAID support evaporating, scientists are now rushing to secure alternative funding, hoping the US National Institutes of Health will step in to prioritize the work. But it&rsquo;s unclear whether NIH &mdash; part of the Department of Health and Human Services &mdash; will be spared from broader austerity.Job CutsHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans Thursday to slash 10,000 jobs and shrink the agency&rsquo;s budget by $1.8 billion, part of the Trump administration&rsquo;s push to dramatically reduce the federal workforce and realign government with what it calls core priorities, including &ldquo;reversing the chronic disease epidemic.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;These programmes don&rsquo;t have on/off switches,&rdquo; AVAC&rsquo;s Warren said. &ldquo;The science, infrastructure, and community relationships built over the last two decades are being erased in just weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp;Researchers estimate that hundreds of millions of dollars are still needed to bring an effective HIV vaccine to the finish line &mdash; a sum unlikely to come from any single donor.&nbsp;&ldquo;For the first time, based on work that&rsquo;s come out over the past few years, we know what the goal is and we have a good idea about how to achieve that goal,&rdquo; said Mark Feinberg, IAVI&rsquo;s president and chief executive officer, in an interview before the proposed funding cuts came to light. &ldquo;We really need an HIV vaccine if we&rsquo;re going to end this epidemic.&rdquo;&nbsp;In response to the wave of cuts, the activist group ACT UP is organizing a protest march in New York City on Saturday, targeting the sweeping healthcare freezes enacted by President Donald Trump, Kennedy, and Elon Musk &mdash; the billionaire running Trump&rsquo;s federal cost-cutting drive. The demonstration aims to spotlight billions of dollars in halted funding for lifesaving medications and global health programmes.",

    "body": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk, whom US President Donald Trump has tapped to shrink the government, said on Thursday he would finish most of the work to cut $1 trillion in federal spending when his tenure ends in as soon as 64 days.&nbsp;Musk told Fox News&#39; &quot;Special Report with Bret Baier&quot; that he was confident his Department of Government Efficiency could find $1 trillion in savings, slimming current total federal spending levels of about $7 trillion down to $6 trillion.&nbsp;Musk, the world&#39;s richest person, was designated by the White House as a &quot;special government employee,&quot; which caps his work at 130 days. That means his period leading the DOGE operation could finish as soon as the end of May.&nbsp;&quot;I think we will accomplish most of the work required to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars within that time frame,&quot; Musk said when asked by Baier about his tenure and how quickly he expected to achieve his cost-cutting target.&nbsp;&quot;The government is not efficient, and there is a lot of waste and fraud, so we feel confident that a 15% reduction can be done without affecting any of the critical government services,&quot; Musk said.&nbsp;DOGE estimates it has saved US taxpayers $115 billion as of March 24 through actions including workforce reductions, asset sales and contract cancellations.&nbsp;However, the savings total published on the DOGE website is unverifiable and its calculations have been riddled with errors and corrections. Budget experts say Musk cannot reach his target without touching entitlement programs like Social Security, which Trump has vowed not to cut.&nbsp;The interview marked the first time that Musk and his top lieutenants at DOGE met with media to explain their work.&nbsp;Musk was joined by seven other DOGE executives, including Steve Davis, the president of Musk&#39;s tunneling enterprise the Boring Company, and Joe Gebbia, co-founder of Airbnb.&nbsp;&quot;Unless this exercise is successful, the ship of America will sink. That&#39;s why we&#39;re doing it,&quot; said Musk, who is also CEO of electric car maker Tesla.&nbsp;Musk&#39;s role in slashing the federal workforce and government agency budgets has drawn political backlash in recent weeks, with Tesla cars and dealerships hit by a spate of vandalism and demonstrations across the country.&nbsp;(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)&nbsp;",

    "title": "US judge temporarily blocks parts of Trump's anti-DEI executive orders",
    "body": "A federal judge has temporarily blocked the US Department of Labour from implementing parts of President Donald Trump&#39;s executive orders aimed at curbing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts among federal contractors and grant recipients.Judge Matthew Kennelly of the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois halted the Labour Department from requiring federal contractors or grant recipients from certifying that they don&#39;t operate any programmes in violation of Trump&#39;s anti-DEI executive orders.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Donald Trump has companies in Europe and Asia walking DEI tightropeThat certification provision has stepped up pressure on companies and other organisations to revisit their DEI practices because if the government were to determine they violated the provision, they would be subject to crippling financial penalties under the False Claims Act.Thursday&#39;s ruling is in response to a lawsuit filed by Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit founded in 1981 that helps prepare women for work in skilled construction trades and has several contracts with the Department of Labour.There was no immediate reaction from Chicago Women in Trades to Kennelly&#39;s order. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A hearing on Chicago Women in Trades&#39; bid for a longer-lasting halt on Trump&#39;s anti-DEI executive orders is scheduled for April 10.The organization&#39;s lawsuit is one of several challenging Trump&#39;s executive orders targeting DEI programmes in both the private and public sectors.Trump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all equity-related grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order that included a requirement that federal contractors and grantees certify that they don&#39;t operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.Kennelly&#39;s decision comes nearly two weeks after an appeals court lifted a broader nationwide injunction against Trump&#39;s anti-DEI executive orders in a separate lawsuit in Baltimore. But Thursday&#39;s ruling is limited in scope because Kennelly declined to extend the temporary restraining order to other federal agencies.Chicago Women in Trades, which filed its case against the Trump administration last month, argued that the president&#39;s executive orders on DEI are so broad and vague that the organisation had no way to ensure compliance, and thus they threaten its core mission.Kennelly wrote that Chicago Women in Trades, which is being represented by the Lawyers&#39; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was likely to succeed in its arguments that parts of the executive orders are a violation of free speech rights and are unconstitutionally vague.Although the government argued that the certification provision implicates only illegal DEI programmes, it has studiously declined to shed any light on what this means. The answer is anything but obvious, Kennelly wrote.Kennelly wrote that he extended his order to all Labour Department contractors and grant recipients because the vagueness of Trump&#39;s executive orders, coupled with the threat of financial penalties, would likely pressure organisations to curb DEI programmes in potential violation of free speech rights.Rather than face potentially crippling penalties, it is likely that many of these grantees will take the safer route and choose to simply stop speaking on anything remotely related to what the government might consider to promote DEI or equity. A nationwide restraining order is appropriate to protect grantees who cannot afford the risks inherent in biting the hand that feeds them,&quot; Kennelly wrote.The judge also blocked the DOL from freezing or cancelling any funding with Chicago Women in Trades, and the Trump administration from pursuing any False Claims Act enforcement against them.During a hearing on Tuesday, the Trump administration argued that Chicago Women in Trades&#39; motion for relief was premature because its arguments rely on speculation as to how the executive orders will be implemented.But Chicago Women in Trades noted in court filings that it has multiple communications from the Department of Labour directing them to ensure compliance with both DEI executive orders. The organisation also said in court and has already lost a subcontract with a contractor trying to comply with the executive order.Chicago Women in Trades has a long history of partnering with companies, state and federal agencies and other industry stakeholders to provide guidance and training on best practices for recruiting and retaining women in the trades including training to combat bias and harassment that is prevalent in one of the country&#39;s most male-dominated industries.Its grant work with the federal government dates back years, including two grants awarded under the first Trump administration under the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations, which aims to expand pathways for women seeking to enter skilled trades.",

But this task takes much time and energy.Although the duties of a constitutional monarch are largely ceremonial, the royal whirl can be exhausting.Besides the occasional procession in full royal regalia, there are meetings with political leaders, dedication ceremonies and events honouring the accomplishments of British citizens.That added up to 161 days of royal engagements during Charles&#39; first year on the throne.Charles&#39; illness came as his daughter-in-law, Kate, the Princess of Wales, was also diagnosed with cancer. Kate, the wife of Prince William, took more than six months off before returning to public duties in late September.",

    "body": "Suspected US airstrikes pummelled sites across Yemen controlled by the Houthi rebels early Friday, including neighbourhoods in the capital, Sanaa.The extent of the damage and possible casualties wasn&#39;t immediately clear, though the number of strikes appeared particularly intense compared to other days in the campaign that began March 15.An Associated Press review has found the new American operation under President Donald Trump appears more more extensive than those under former president Joe Biden, as the US moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel as well as dropping bombs in cities.Initial reports from the Houthi-controlled SABA news agency referenced only one person being hurt in the attacks on Friday in Sanaa, Yemen&#39;s capital that the rebels have held since 2014.Other strikes hit around the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, the rebel&#39;s stronghold of Saada and in Yemen&#39;s al-Jawf and Amran governorates.The Houthis did not immediately acknowledge what at those sites had been targeted, other than Sanaa International Airport, which is used for both civilian and military traffic.Neighbourhoods in the capital are also home to military and intelligence service sites -- as well as crowded with civilians.Other areas hit included mountainous terrain north of Sanaa, where military camps and other installations are believed to be. The Houthis&#39; al-Masirah satellite news network described communication networks going down after the attacks.The US military&#39;s Central Command, which now has authority from the White House to strike offensively in Yemen without pre-approval, did not immediately acknowledge conducting any strikes.The command, which under Biden offered details on individual strikes, has not provided that information in this campaign.The campaign of airstrikes targeting the rebels, which killed at least 57 people immediately after they began March 15, started after the Houthis threatened to begin targeting Israeli ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip.The rebels in the past have had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year.They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none have been hit so far.The attacks greatly raised the Houthis&#39; profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen&#39;s decade-long stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world&#39;s poorest nation.",

    "body": "In a significant gesture of mercy during the holy month of Ramadan, the UAE has announced a large-scale pardon for prisoners, with over 500 Indian nationals among those released. The decision, which was implemented in late February, saw President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan order the release of 1,295 inmates, while Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum granted clemency to 1,518 prisoners.This annual tradition of pardoning prisoners during Ramadan reflects the UAE&#39;s commitment to justice, compassion, and maintaining strong diplomatic relations with India. It is a significant symbol of mercy and reconciliation in line with the spirit of the Holy Month.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;UAE eyes investment in tourism, healthcare sectors in Kerala: MinisterThe clemency granted by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid applies to individuals of various nationalities who were held in Dubai&#39;s correctional and punitive facilities. The pardon is aimed at allowing them to reunite with their families and reintegrate into society.Attorney General of Dubai, Chancellor Essam Issa Al-Humaidan, stated that the decision reflects Sheikh Mohammed&#39;s dedication to offering a fresh start to those who have served their sentences. He confirmed that Dubai Public Prosecution, in coordination with Dubai Police, has already begun implementing the legal procedures for their release.Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed&#39;s initiative extends beyond granting clemency, as he has also pledged to settle the financial obligations of the released prisoners. This move is intended to alleviate the burdens on both the inmates and their families, fostering stability within households and ensuring they can begin anew without financial constraints.The annual Ramadan pardons are part of the UAE&#39;s tradition of showing mercy and providing second chances. The initiative aligns with the values of the Holy Month, promoting forgiveness, compassion, and rehabilitation. The mass release also serves a practical role in reducing prison populations while reinforcing social stability.",

    "title": "Key issues in Australia's election: Cost of living, housing, China, energy",
    "body": "Australians will go to the polls on May 3 for general elections with high costs of living and a shortage of housing likely weighing against the government as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese&#39;s centre-left Labour Party seeks a second three-year term.The elections will be dominated by the soaring cost of living, the economy, energy and China.Affordable housing is in short supply, interest rates remain high and the major parties are starkly divided on how to wean the nation off fossil fuel-generated electricity.The major parties also differ on how to deal with China, which is at once Australia&#39;s largest trading partner and its greatest strategic threat.Here&#39;s what you need to know about the main issues:Surging inflationAustralians have endured one of the sharpest rises in the cost of living in recent history and the current government has been at the helm through the worst of it.Egg prices surged 11 per cent last year and beer rose 4 per cent, according to government figures.Australian rents rose 4.8 per cent last year after a 8.1 per cent spike in 2023, property analyst CoreLogic said.The central bank&#39;s benchmark cash rate rose from a record low 0.1 per cent to 0.35 per cent two weeks before Albanese&#39;s center-left Labour Party came to power at elections in May 2022.The rate rose a dozen times since then, peaking at 4.35 per cent in November 2023. Inflation peaked that year at 7.8 per cent.The central bank reduced the cash rate by a quarter percentage point in February to 4.1 per cent in an indication that the worst the cost of living crisis had passed.Scarce and expensive housingInflation has put some builders out of business, exacerbating a shortage of housing which in turn has inflated rents.The government has provided tax cuts and assistance for some rent and energy bills, but critics argue government spending has contributed to maintaining elevated inflation.Albanese promised in 2023 to build 1.2 million homes through incentives over five years starting mid last year, an ambitious target in a country of 27 million people. Early building approval figures suggest his government will miss that target.The opposition has promised to reduce competition for housing by reducing immigration. It&#39;s also promised to allow Australians to spend money held in their compulsory workplace pension funds, known as superannuation, on down payments to buy a home.Different paths to net zeroBoth parties agree on the goal: to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.The opposition has promised to build seven government-funded nuclear power plants across Australia, the first providing electricity in 2035.The government argues Australia&#39;s existing coal and gas-fired generators won&#39;t last long enough to meet the nation&#39;s needs until nuclear power arrives. It plans to have 82 per cent of Australia&#39;s energy grid powered by renewables by 2030.The opposition argues the government&#39;s policy of replacing coal and gas with renewable energy sources including wind turbines and solar cells is unachievable, and would reduce investment in clean energy technologies.The government was elected in 2022 with a promise to reduce Australia&#39;s greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent below 2005 levels by the end of the decade and achieve net zero by 2050.The opposition won&#39;t set a new target for 2030 before the election but retains a commitment to net-zero by 2050 with nuclear power.Ties with ChinaTrade and diplomatic relations between Australia and China plumbed new depths in 2020 after the previous conservative Australian government demanded an international inquiry into the origins of and responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.Beijing barred minister-to-minister contacts with Australia and imposed a series of official and unofficial bans on commodities including coal, wine, barley, wood and lobsters that cost Australian exporters up to 20 billion Australian dollars (USD 13 billion) a year.The thaw started almost immediately with the election of the centre-left Labour Party in 2022. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang wrote to congratulate Prime Minister Albanese on his election victory within days.All the trade barriers were gradually lifted and Albanese met President Xi Jinping during a state visit to Beijing in 2023.Albanese often says about China: We will cooperate where we can, disagree where we must and engage in the national interest.Opposition leader Peter Dutton, a longtime critic of China, has said bilateral relations would improve even further with a tough and uncompromising approach.He has accused Albanese of self-censorship to avoid offending Beijing.Australia must be willing to criticize any nation whose behaviour imperils stability in the region, and that&#39;s what a coalition government I lead will do confidently and in concert with like-minded countries, Dutton told the Lowy Institute international policy think-tank in Sydney this month.",

    "title": "Top MS-13 gang leader held in Virginia during major Trump-backed operation",
    "body": "US authorities arrested a high-ranking MS-13 gang leader in Virginia on Thursday morning, marking a significant victory in a nationwide crackdown on violent criminal networks. Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, a 24-year-old illegal migrant, was taken into custody on weapons charges during a raid in Prince William County, located about 23 miles outside Washington, DC, the New York Post reported.Law enforcement officials described Villatoro as one of the top leaders responsible for orchestrating MS-13&#39;s violent crimes along the East Coast.The arrest was part of a major operation spearheaded by a new FBI-led task force, which has already resulted in the detention of 340 illegal migrant criminals this month. The task force, launched on March 3, involves collaboration between the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Virginia State Police, and the Prince William County Police Department. FBI Director Kash Patel praised the success of the initiative, emphasising its impact in restoring law and order.&quot;This is what happens when you let good cops be cops,&quot; Patel said at a press conference. He also credited the leadership of Attorney General Pam Bondi, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin for their coordinated efforts. &quot;The arrest of an MS-13 leader this morning is a critical victory for law enforcement and a strong message to violent gangs: your days of terrorising our communities are numbered,&quot; he told the New York Post.Authorities located Villatoro after conducting surveillance on his mother&#39;s home in Woodbridge.According to court documents, an FBI SWAT team breached the front and rear doors of the house, finding Villatoro hiding in an alcove near the garage. When he refused to surrender, agents deployed a stun grenade before taking him into custody. A search of his bedroom in the garage uncovered multiple weapons, including a Taurus G2C 9mm handgun, three additional firearms, ammunition, and two silencers.Attorney General Bondi underscored the severity of Villatoro&#39;s role within MS-13. &quot;Make no mistake--he was one of the top leaders, heading up all MS-13 violent crimes on the East Coast. He was responsible for heinous acts, and he should never have been in this country,&quot; she stated.Governor Youngkin reinforced Virginia&#39;s position against sanctuary policies, warning that jurisdictions refusing to cooperate with federal authorities were endangering their communities. &quot;Look who&#39;s in your community. Look who&#39;s living around the corner from citizens that are going to work, trying to build their lives in a place that&#39;s the best place in America to live and work and raise a family,&quot; Youngkin said. He criticised sanctuary cities for providing refuge to dangerous criminals and stated that Virginia would not tolerate such policies. &quot;We are working to get the bad guys out of here, and if you are a local jurisdiction and not helping us and not cooperating with us, you are working against the safety of all of those men and women that call your jurisdiction home.&quot;Youngkin also issued a warning to counties that do not comply with ICE enforcement, saying, &quot;If counties don&#39;t operate with ICE, we&#39;ll defund them.&quot; He referenced Fairfax County as an example of jurisdictions that have resisted collaboration with federal immigration authorities.Bondi described Villatoro as &quot;the worst of the worst&quot; and linked the arrest to broader efforts initiated under US President Donald Trump&#39;s administration. &quot;President Trump&#39;s directive to me when I became Attorney General was to keep America safe and make America safe again,&quot; she said. &quot;We didn&#39;t need new laws, as President Trump said, we needed a new president.&quot;Interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Erik Siebert emphasised the aggressive approach being taken against criminal organisations. &quot;In less than a month, we have arrested 340 suspects,&quot; he stated. &quot;To the criminals, all I have to say is, &#39;we&#39;re coming.&#39;&quot;MS-13, originally founded in Los Angeles in the 1980s by Salvadoran immigrants, has long been considered one of the most violent gangs operating in the United States. President Trump officially designated it as a terrorist organisation during his administration. The gang has been linked to numerous high-profile killings, kidnappings, and drug-related crimes across the country, particularly in areas such as Washington, DC, California, and Long Island, New York.Communities on Long Island have been especially affected by MS-13&#39;s violent activities. Brentwood and other Suffolk County neighborhoods have witnessed brutal attacks in recent years, including the widely publicised 2016 murders of Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens. Prosecutors said the two teenagers were killed with baseball bats and machetes after gang members believed they had disrespected them on social media. Jairo Saens, a senior MS-13 leader involved in the killings, was sentenced to 60 years in prison earlier this year.Local law enforcement officials in New York have expressed strong interest in implementing a task force similar to Virginia&#39;s. Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney stated that he would welcome federal support in combating gang violence. &quot;Because of the violent history of MS-13 on Long Island, law enforcement in Nassau and Suffolk counties have been working with our state and federal partners all along,&quot; he said. &quot;If our federal partners want to expand, it&#39;s a great idea, and we hope that it would bring funding, which would allow us to do more to combat these dangerous gangs.&quot;Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly also called for stronger federal intervention and urged New York Governor Kathy Hochul to consider establishing a similar initiative. &quot;Gov. Hochul should be open to a conversation about having a gang task force here. I support it. We should do everything in our power to take down these gangs,&quot; she said, as per reports by the New York Post.An FBI spokesperson confirmed that the Virginia task force&#39;s success would serve as a model for other states. &quot;This task force proves what&#39;s possible when strong leadership meets real collaboration. In just four weeks, we took down 342 criminals in Virginia by uniting state, local, and federal resources--backed by DOJ and driven by AG Pam Bondi&#39;s vision,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;With Governor Youngkin setting the standard, we&#39;re now taking this model nationwide to restore law and order in communities across America.&quot;The latest operation follows last week&#39;s arrest of Francisco Javier Roman-Bardales, a fugitive MS-13 member previously listed among the FBI&#39;s &quot;Ten Most Wanted.&quot; Bondi reaffirmed the administration&#39;s dedication to dismantling the gang. &quot;MS-13 is one of the most dangerous gangs in our country, and we are going to fight until they are completely dismantled,&quot; she said.",

Dlouhy and Derek Wallbank&nbsp;President Donald Trump signed a proclamation directing the Smithsonian Institution to remove references to &ldquo;improper ideology&rdquo; from its programs and exhibitions, the latest effort from the White House to crack down on teachings regarding race and gender.&nbsp;The proclamation, which Trump signed on Thursday, called for the Smithsonian &mdash; a network of museums and research centers that is not formally part of the federal government &mdash; to remove &ldquo;ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history.&rdquo;&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;President Donald Trump&#39;s punishing tariffs stun US&#39; automaker allies&nbsp;&ldquo;Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,&rdquo; according to the document.&nbsp;Trump in his second term has targeted diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the government and private sector, as well as at cultural institutions, such as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Trump and his allies claim that organizations such as the Smithsonian &ldquo;promote narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.&rdquo;&nbsp;The directive calls for Vice President JD Vance, the Office of Management and Budget and lawmakers to ensure that the future programs do not &ldquo;degrade shared American values&rdquo; or &ldquo;divide Americans based on race.&rdquo; It also calls for a review of Interior Department monuments, memorials and other sites to ensure that signs do not include &ldquo;partisan ideology.&rdquo;&nbsp;About two-thirds of the Smithsonian&rsquo;s annual budget is from congressional appropriations, with the rest coming from donations, membership dues and on-site sales.&nbsp;The moves come after years of introspection by federal officials into how America&rsquo;s story is told and which parts are included or omitted in that narrative.&nbsp;For example, at California&rsquo;s Muir Woods National Monument, where redwood trees soar above a valley just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, park rangers in recent years added yellow sticky notes to signs about the history of the site. The additions were later incorporated into new signs, including details about Native Americans and the racist views of some prominent White figures from the park&rsquo;s history.&nbsp;&ldquo;The role of the National Park Service is to preserve history - the good, the bad, the ugly, and everything in between,&rdquo; reads a portion of the Muir Woods website. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not our job to judge what history is worth telling, but to share an accurate and comprehensive history.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",

The judge added that Taal had not established that she had jurisdiction to halt his removal proceedings, which play out in immigration courts.Taal, a doctoral student in Africana studies, was suspended last fall after a group of pro-Palestinian activists disrupted a campus career fair. He has been continuing his studies remotely.A call seeking comment was made to Taal&#39;s lawyer.",

Its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, had been added to the discussion that included Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice-President J D Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.In the chat, Hegseth provided the exact timings of warplane launches and when bombs would drop before the attacks against Yemen&#39;s Houthis began earlier this month.Hegseth laid out when a strike window would open, where a target terrorist was located and when weapons and aircraft would be used.American Oversight sued this week to ensure that the records are kept in accordance with the Federal Records Act. The group suspects that administration officials routinely use Signal to communicate.&quot;Defendants&#39; use of a non-classified commercial application even for such life-and-death matters as planning a military operation leads to the inevitable inference that Defendants must have used Signal to conduct other official government business,&quot; American Oversight&#39;s attorneys wrote in a court filing.Boasberg limited his order to messages sent between March 11 and March 15.We are still ascertaining what records the agencies have,&quot; Justice Department attorney Amber Richer said.I&#39;m glad we could figure out a solution, the judge later said, as he instructed the government to provide him with an update on Monday.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said no classified information was posted to the Signal chat.Hegseth&#39;s spokesman, Sean Parnell, said in a statement on Wednesday that there were no classified materials or war plans shared. The Secretary was merely updating the group on a plan that was underway&quot;.Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that Hegseth was responsible for determining whether the information was classified.American Oversight&#39;s attorneys argued that the public is entitled to access government records even if they are auto-deleting messages that originated on officials&#39; private phones.&quot;This is nothing less than a systematic effort to evade the rules for record retention in the federal government,&quot; they wrote.There is no legitimate reason for this behaviour, which deprives the public and Congress of an ability to see the actions of government.",

    "title": "Canada immigration backlog drops below 830,000 as IRCC speeds up processing",
    "body": "The backlog of immigration applications at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) continues to shrink, with the department processing more files within its set service standards. In March, 2025, the backlog stands at 821,200 &mdash; down from 892,100 in January. That&rsquo;s a monthly drop of 7.95 per cent. It also marks the third month in a row that the backlog has remained under the 1 million mark, according to IRCC data.&nbsp;Total applications across all immigration categories reached 2,029,400 at the end of February. Of those, 1,208,200 were processed within service standards, which vary by programme.&nbsp;What is counted as a backlog?&nbsp;IRCC considers an application to be part of the backlog if it takes longer than the department&rsquo;s service standard. For instance:&nbsp;Express Entry applications are expected to be processed within six months&nbsp;&nbsp;Family sponsorship applications are expected within 12 months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If processing time exceeds these, the application joins the backlog.&nbsp;IRCC says its target is to process 80 per cent of applications within these timelines, with the remaining 20 per cent taking longer due to complexity.&nbsp;Backlog over the past six months&nbsp;The backlog has been falling since September 2024. Here&#39;s a month-by-month look:&nbsp;September, 2024: 1,097,000 applications (+1.73 per cent)&nbsp;&nbsp;October, 2024: 1,056,100 (-3.73 per cent)&nbsp;&nbsp;November, 2024: 1,006,500 (-4.70 per cent)&nbsp;&nbsp;December, 2024: 942,300 (-6.38 per cent)&nbsp;&nbsp;January, 2025: 892,100 (-5.33 per cent)&nbsp;&nbsp;February, 2025: 821,200 (-7.95 per cent)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent resident applications&nbsp;There were 842,600 permanent residence applications in the inventory at the end of February, including Express Entry, the Provincial Nominee Programme (PNP), and family sponsorship streams.&nbsp;Of these:&nbsp;478,600 (57 per cent) were within service standards&nbsp;&nbsp;364,000 were in the backlog&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While IRCC does not give exact numbers per stream, 25 per cent of Express Entry applications were in the backlog&mdash;above the 20 per cent threshold.&nbsp;Backlog in the Express Entry-aligned PNP stream rose to 36 per cent in February, up from 30 per cent in January. In contrast, the family sponsorship backlog dropped slightly to 14 per cent from 15 per cent the month before.&nbsp;Temporary resident applications&nbsp;Temporary residence programmes had a backlog of 414,500 out of 947,200 total applications. Only 56 per cent were processed on time.&nbsp;&lt; 65 per cent of visitor visa applications were backlogged. IRCC&#39;s internal target is 50 per cent&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; 45 per cent of study permit applications were delayed, while the projected backlog is 24 per cent&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; Work permit applications had the lowest backlog rate at 34 per cent&mdash;the lowest since July 2023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship applications&nbsp;Citizenship continues to be the least affected category. Out of 239,600 total applications, 196,900 were within service standards.&nbsp;This leaves an 18 per cent backlog&mdash;still below the department&rsquo;s 20 per cent target.&nbsp;How is IRCC tackling the backlog?&nbsp;IRCC has introduced several measures to control growing inventories, particularly after the pandemic years.&nbsp;Automation and analytics: In a November 2024 update, IRCC said it was using digital tools to speed up processing. &ldquo;These tools help identify straightforward applications and support officers with summaries for decision-making,&rdquo; the department noted. Over 80 per cent of visitor visa applications now use automation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application caps: A cap on new international study permits in 2024 has reduced intake by around 35 per cent compared to 2023. Approved permits have been limited to 360,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stable immigration targets: According to the Immigration Levels Plan 2025&ndash;27, Canada will hold steady at 485,000 permanent residents in 2025, and 500,000 in both 2026 and 2027. &ldquo;This stability allows us to better manage inventories and improve predictability,&rdquo; IRCC said.",

    "title": "Gold rally too good to last? What history teaches about gains, volatility",
    "body": "Gold has been on a remarkable rally recently, with returns soaring into the upper distribution tranches. However, as with any asset that experiences such strong gains, caution is advised by DSP Mutual Fund. Historically, sharp increases in gold prices have been followed by equally steep declines, making it crucial to recognize the cyclical nature of the precious metal.&nbsp;Looking at historical data from the past four and a half decades, the annual returns for gold have fluctuated significantly. Annual returns of 40-50% have occurred only six times, which means such results are more of an anomaly than a typical outcome, as per DSP Mutual Fund. The more frequent scenario&mdash;nearly 25% of the time&mdash;has been a negative return of up to 10%, underscoring the downside risks inherent to gold investments.&nbsp; No trend lasts forever:&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in just under half of the instances, gold has actually declined in value over a one-year period. This data reinforces the reality that despite gold&rsquo;s reputation as a safe haven, it remains a volatile asset subject to cyclical swings.&nbsp;These patterns highlight a fundamental truth: while gold can offer substantial upside during periods of strong market performance, the downside risks are equally considerable. Investors must approach gold with an understanding of its cyclical nature and recognize that enthusiasm over recent rallies should not overshadow the potential for sharp corrections.&nbsp;As gold continues to rise, the key takeaway is that positioning in this asset should be done carefully, with full awareness of the volatility that comes with the glittering appeal of gold.&nbsp;Looking at historical data of 1 year returns over the past four and a half decades, DSP Mutual Fund makes the following analysis:&nbsp;&bull; Annual returns of 40-50% have occurred only six times, making such an outcome an outlier rather than a precedent.&bull; The most frequent outcome&mdash;nearly 25% of the time&mdash;has been a negative return of up to 10%, highlighting the asset&rsquo;s inherent downside risks.&bull; In just under half of the instances, gold has actually declined in value over a one-year period&nbsp;What should investors do? As per DPS Mutual Fund:All assets are cyclical. Gold, a proven store of value and strong performer, is a valuable portfolio addition.Silver is undervalued with respect to Gold prices. The Gold to Silver ratio is close to 88:1 versus its long period average of 65:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "body": "As many as 77 per cent of young professionals in India research rewards and prices of digital payment services before making financial decisions, said a survey on Thursday.&nbsp;Despite diligence 48 per cent of them feel they are losing money due to inefficient payment choices, according to the survey Kiwi, a credit-on-UPI platform, conducted in collaboration with Unomer, a digital consumer insights firm. The survey asked professionals aged 21-35 about payment options and rewards.&nbsp;As many as 50 per cent of respondents want guaranteed cashback for every transaction. As many as 49 per cent want rewards irrespective of transaction size, indicating a need for more inclusive benefits.&nbsp;Frustration with reward structures was evident, as 27 per cent of respondents specifically called out scratch cards bearing messages like &lsquo;Better luck next time&rsquo; as a source of disappointment. This highlights a shift in consumer expectations toward assured returns instead of chance-based incentives.&nbsp;As many as 67 per cent of respondents said their biggest concern was financial loss while making payments. Moreover, 44 per cent view missed rewards and points as a form of financial loss, further reinforcing the demand for transparent and predictable reward systems.&nbsp;UPI vs credit cards&nbsp;The survey also explored payment preferences, revealing that 70 per cent of young professionals use UPI (Unified Payments Interface) for daily small transactions, while 81 per cent rely on it for in-person payments, appreciating its widespread acceptance noted by 85 per cent of respondents. However, despite UPI&#39;s dominance, 74 per cent of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with its immediate deduction from savings accounts.&nbsp;Conversely, 81 per cent value credit cards for their interest-free credit periods, indicating a preference for financial flexibility. The findings suggest a strong consumer interest in a hybrid payment solution that merges UPI&rsquo;s convenience with the benefits of credit cards.&nbsp;The survey highlights a deliberate approach to spending among India&rsquo;s youth. About 75 per cent of respondents wait for sales before making major purchases, while 56 per cent actively choose payment methods that offer the best discounts. This price-conscious behavior underscores the need for financial institutions to align their offerings with evolving consumer expectations.&nbsp;&ldquo;As digital payments evolve, India&rsquo;s young professionals are becoming more conscious of how they spend, save, and maximize value. Consumers don&rsquo;t like to lose out&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s on rewards, cashback, or smarter payment options,&rdquo; said Mohit Bedi, co-founder and chief business officer of Kiwi.&nbsp;&ldquo;Our survey reveals that young Indian consumers are highly price-conscious and strategic in their spending habits, making it imperative for financial institutions to adapt to meet the evolving preferences of this demographic,&rdquo; said Vinay Bapna, co-founder and chief executive officer of Unomer.&nbsp;With young consumers demanding more rewarding payment options, financial service providers may need to rethink their offerings to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving digital payments landscape.&nbsp;Methodology&nbsp;The survey was conducted across Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, and Pune. Respondents were selected based on recent usage of both credit cards (within the past month) and UPI (within the past two weeks). The data was collected between March 14 and 17 through a mobile-based self-administered questionnaire to ensure accessibility and convenience for participants.",

Choosing between Mutual Funds (MFs) and Portfolio Management Services (PMS) depends on your financial goals, risk appetite, and investment preferences,&rdquo; Spokesperson of a portfolio management services said.&nbsp;Features of a MF & PMS.&nbsp;FeatureMutual FundsPortfolio Management Services (PMS)StructurePooled investment fundPersonalized, individual portfolio&nbsp;&nbsp;ManagementProfessional, fund manager-drivenActive, personalized portfolio management&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment MinimumLow ( Rs 500 to Rs 5,000)High (minimum INR 50 lakhs)FeesGenerally mutual funds are less costlier compared to PMSsLiquidityHigh (generally, can redeem anytime)Moderate (depends on portfolio&#39;s composition)RiskDiversified riskHigher risk, more concentrated investmentsReturn PotentialModerate, consistent returnsHigher potential returns with more riskTaxationCapital gains tax on mutual fund unitsCapital gains tax on direct investments&nbsp;Difference between MF and PMS&nbsp;Both are managed by professionals and offer a diversified portfolio, but the difference lies in how they&rsquo;re structured and their costs.&nbsp;Mutual funds are more accessible and flexible as an investment option. They typically hold a broader mix of stocks, often around 60, making them inherently more diversified. They&rsquo;re also heavily regulated, which adds a layer of security for investors. A PMS investment operates with a smaller basket, usually of 30-50 stocks, and requires a minimum investment of Rs 50 lakh, making it suitable mostly for the ultra-high net worth individuals.&nbsp;There are around 43 asset management companies, each offering multiple fund categories, and hence, you have over 700 mutual fund schemes to choose from. PMS, on the other hand, limits you to just one portfolio per investment, making diversification much harder.&nbsp;Shweta Rajani, head - mutual funds at Anand Rathi Wealth, explained factors investors should consider before choosing between MFs and PMS.&nbsp;Diversification: Mutual funds offer a much larger basket of stocks and securities and thus provide investors with much more diversification benefits. PMS has much more concentration risk, with the basket of securities being smaller.&nbsp;Investors should keep in mind that costs are much higher in PMS due to management fees of 2-3 per cent and performance fees separately. This eats into the return generated. Mutual funds usually only have management fees, and a lower expense ratio.&nbsp;Another thing to keep in mind for investors is the tax implications. In PMS, every transaction made by the portfolio manager has tax implications for the investor since trades happen through their demat account. But in mutual funds, taxation happens at the trust level, which makes it far more efficient.&nbsp;When considering the risk-adjusted returns, an investor should choose mutual funds over a PMS, as a well-diversified portfolio will have higher returns than that of a concentrated one. Investors should diversify across different funds to optimize returns while managing risk.&nbsp;&ldquo;There is no ideal investment amount &mdash; it depends on an individual&rsquo;s overall portfolio, liquidity needs, and long-term financial vision. The key to wealth creation lies in making informed, strategic decisions that align with your financial aspirations,&rdquo; the spokesperson said.&nbsp;",

    "body": "Skyrocketing residential prices coupled with geopolitical headwinds have slowed the Indian housing market&rsquo;s bull-run in Q1 2025. Latest data from property consulting firm Anarock shows that the year&#39;s first quarter saw sales drop 28% across the top seven cities in India against the same period in 2024. Approximately 93,280 units were sold in Q1 2025 in the top 7 cities, in sharp contrast to all-time high sales of over 1.30 lakh units in Q1 2024.&nbsp;&quot;MMR and Pune accounted for 51% of the total sales, with MMR seeing a 26% yearly drop and Pune a decline of over 30%. At 49%, Hyderabad saw the highest annual drop in sales, while Bengaluru had the lowest decline at 16%,&quot; said Anuj Puri, Chairman - ANAROCK Group.&nbsp;New launches across the top 7 cities remained above the one lakh mark but saw a 10% yearly decline &ndash; from approx. 1,10,865 units in Q1 2024 to approx. 1,00,020 units in Q1 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Notably, MMR and Bengaluru saw the maximum new supply in Q1 2025, accounting for 52% of the total new launches across the top 7 cities,&quot; adds Puri. &quot;While MMR saw new supply drop by 9% annually, Bengaluru saw new supply increase by 27% in this period.

In contrast, Bengaluru saw its unsold stock rise by a significant 28% - to approx. 58,660 units - by Q1 2025-end.&nbsp;&ldquo;Rising housing prices and global headwinds like ongoing geopolitical tensions and a weak global economy, has taken their toll on India&#39;s residential market activity.

This was primarily due to steep new supply additions in the luxury and ultra- luxury segment, and overall strong demand. NCR and Bengaluru recorded the highest annual price jump of over 34% and 20%, respectively.&nbsp;New Launch OverviewThe top 7 cities saw approx. 1,00,020 units launched in Q1 2025, against approx. 1,10,865 units in Q1 2024 - a 10% decline.

This also marked the highest level of selling post Covid-19.&nbsp;Alongside this, weaker-than-expected corporate earnings in Q3 of FY25, concerns over lofty valuations, and the looming uncertainty around potential tariff policies under a second-term US President, Donald Trump, added to the market&#39;s struggles.&nbsp;Global tensions, particularly ongoing conflicts in Russia, Ukraine, and the Middle East, further intensified market volatility, leaving investors uncertain and on edge.&nbsp; Read: Stock Market LIVE Updates&nbsp;In the broader market, the Nifty 500 Index posted a modest gain of 5.7 per cent for FY25, while the Nifty 50 Index mirrored this performance, also seeing a 5.7 per cent increase, Bloomberg data showed.

In the past two days, the stock price of the state-owned company has rallied 22 per cent after it secured a contract worth of ₹405 crore from Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL).&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract is for design, manufacture, supply, installation, testing and commissioning of standard gauge metro cars and training of personnel including comprehensive maintenance up to fifteen (15) years under Bengaluru Metro Rail Projects.&nbsp;Analysts expect rail & metro (R&M) to pick up momentum in FY26, given the pipeline for Mumbai Metro 4, 5 & 6 lines and Bhubaneswar Metro projects.&nbsp;Meanwhile, BEML has announced a mining equipment manufacturing plant in Chhattisgarh. This plant will focus on producing high-performance dump trucks, water sprinklers, and motor graders. This will cater to the increasing demand in the mining and infrastructure sectors, the company said.&nbsp;At 10:04 am; BEML was quoting 5 per cent higher at ₹3,302, as compared to 0.14 per cent decline in Nifty 50. With the past two days&#39; gain, the stock has recovered 43 per cent from its 52-week low of ₹2,350 touched on March 3, 2025. It had hit a 52-week high of ₹5,488 on July 5, 2024.&nbsp;BEML is a leading multi-technology &lsquo;Schedule A&rsquo; company under the Ministry of Defence, plays a pivotal role in serving India&rsquo;s core sectors like Defence, Rail, Power, Mining and Construction by offering world class products.&nbsp;On March 12, 2025, BEML and Siemens India signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to jointly explore opportunities in the semi-high-speed and suburban passenger train segments, as well as metro and commuter rail markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;BEML and Dragflow S.R.L., Italy Forge, also signed an MOU to Strengthen Indigenous Dredging Solutions.&nbsp;Last month, BEML signed a strategic partnership with STX Engine, a renowned South Korean company, to co-develop, manufacture, and market Battle Tank engines, marine engines, spares, and engine aggregates. The agreement also includes servicing and maintenance of engine components to cater to Indian defence needs while exploring export opportunities to friendly nations.&nbsp;Analysts at Elara Capital believe revenue from mining & construction (43 per cent share in FY24) and defence & aerospace (D&A) (19 per cent share in FY24) may have risen, led by execution of a robust orderbook. R&M (38 per cent share in FY24) revenue may have declined significantly due to execution being hit by delay in the Mumbai Metro. The brokerage firm expects to see better performance in January to March 2025 quarter (Q4FY25), led by execution and supply of Vande Bharat & Mumbai Metro orders and supply of Tatra trucks in defence.",

    "body": "Gold: A fresh record high on safe haven demand&nbsp;Performance:On March 27, spot gold rose to a fresh record high of $3,059 on safe haven demand coming on US imposing auto tariffs. A weaker dollar also boosted the yellow metal.&nbsp;Spot gold, at the time of writing, was changing hands at $3,051, up around 1 per cent on the day. The MCX June contract at ₹89,301 was up 1 per cent.&nbsp;Tariff development:On March 26, the US President Trump signed an order to implement a 25 per cent tariff on auto imports, which will be effective from April 3, and will initially target fully assembled vehicles. The President threatened Canada and the European Union (EU) with more tariffs should they work together to do economic harm to the US. He said that tariffs will be permanent with no exceptions. The latest round of tariffs is further escalating tensions with US trade partners ahead of reciprocal tariffs that will come into effect from April 2.&nbsp;The EU vowed to defend its economic interests as Canada called these tariffs violating the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.&nbsp;Top officials from China, Japan and South Korea will meet in Seoul this weekend to seek economic cooperation to counter rising trade frictions.&nbsp;Data roundup:As per the final print, US gross domestic product (GDP) (Q4) rose 2.4 per cent on an annualised basis as personal consumption at 4 per cent trailed the estimate of 4.2 per cent. US Q4 GDP Price Index at 2.3 per cent (forecast 2.4 per cent, prior 2.4 per cent) and Core Price Index at 2.6 per cent (forecast 2.6 per cent, prior 2.7 per cent) were somewhat reassuring on the inflation front.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weekly job data were mixed as initial jobless claims at 2,24,000 came in below the forecast of 2,25,000 whereas continuing claims at 18,56,000 were lower than the estimate of 18,86,000. Pending home sales rose 2 per cent month-on-month (M-o-M) in February, better than the forecast of 1 per cent, but were 7.2 per cent lower year-on-year (Y-o-Y) against the forecast of a decline of 3.5 per cent (Y-o-Y).&nbsp;US dollar Index and yields:Ten-year US yields swung between 4.33 per cent and 4.4 per cent and were at 4.37 per cent, up about 0.75 per cent on the day. Yields are nearly 3 per cent up on the week.&nbsp;Long-term yields are going up on investors&#39; concerns about tariffs being inflationary. The thirty-year yields at 4.75 per cent reached the highest level since February 20. The two-year US yields at 4 per cent were down nearly 1 basis points (bps) at the time of writing this report. The Fed rate cut prospects are weighing on short-term yields.&nbsp;The US Dollar Index was at 104.27, down around 0.3 per cent on the day as traders assessed the impact of tariffs on the US economy. The Index is slightly up on the week though.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Gold price rises Rs 10 to Rs 89,850, silver falls Rs 100 to Rs 1,01,900&nbsp;Upcoming data:Traders will closely monitor the US core PCE Price Index data, the Fed&#39;s preferred gauge of inflation, to be released today. Apart from this data, University of Michigan Sentiment and both short-term and long-term inflation expectations (March Final) will also be crucial as the sentiment has slumped to the lowest since November 2022, whereas long-term inflation expectations are at the highest since 1993.&nbsp;Germany&#39;s unemployment change (March) and EU&#39;s consumer confidence will also influence commodities to some extent.&nbsp;ETF:Total known global gold ETF holdings fell for the first time in 12 days and stood at 87.746MOz as on March 26. Nonetheless, gold ETF holdings are at the highest since September 2023 and are up nearly 6 per cent year-to-date (Y-T-D).&nbsp;The ETFs have recorded inflows for eight straight weeks with major buying coming from North America.&nbsp;COMEX gold inventory:COMEX gold inventory at 42.936MOz remain at all-time high on delivery demand.&nbsp;Outlook:Elevated economic uncertainties and worsening global trade scenario continue to remain supportive for the metal. ETF inflows also continue to support the metal.&nbsp;Although, of late, the US data viz existing home sales, industrial production, weekly job data, etc., have been somewhat comforting, investors continue to remain concerned over the impacts of trade wars on the global economy. Traders will closely keep a tab on fresh tariff developments ahead of the reciprocal tariffs which will come into effect on April 2.&nbsp; Short-term US yields remain depressed on rate cut prospects as markets expect the Fed to start cutting rates from June. Odds of a June rate cut stand around 65 per cent.&nbsp;The yellow metal is likely to trade with a positive bias as traders eye $3,100 in near term. Support is at $3,023 (MCX Gold June ₹88,480)/$3000 (₹87,800).&nbsp;**MCX gold rates have been calculated at USDINR spot rate of Rs 85.67.&nbsp; (Disclaimer: This article is by Praveen Singh &ndash; associate VP, fundamental currencies and commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

    "body": "India&#39;s direct export loss from US reciprocal tariffs could be limited to around 0.1% of GDP, but the broader impact through indirect channels could be significant, as per a new report by CareEdge Ratings, which has raised concerns about the escalating global trade tensions.&nbsp;&nbsp;With trade conflicts intensifying under the leadership of US President Donald Trump, including tariffs targeting China, Canada, and Mexico, the global economic outlook has worsened, with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) revising its global growth forecast downward.&nbsp;Since assuming office, President Trump has initiated multiple tariff actions against major trade partners, and on the horizon, he has threatened to introduce reciprocal tariffs targeting additional economies, the details of which are expected to be disclosed on April 2, 2025. These ongoing measures have stoked concerns about heightened risks to global trade and economic growth. In response, the OECD has adjusted its global growth forecast for 2025 to 3.1%, down from the previously projected 3.3%. Similarly, the 2026 forecast has been lowered to 3.0%, reflecting the adverse impact of these trade tensions.&nbsp;Implications for IndiaIndia faces the risk of reciprocal tariffs from the US due to its goods trade surplus of $35 billion with the US (in FY24) and higher average tariffs on US imports (12%) compared to US tariffs on Indian imports (3%). The CareEdge Ratings analysis suggests that if the US imposes an additional 8% tariff on Indian imports, direct export losses could be limited to around $3.1 billion annually (approximately 0.1% of GDP), assuming that likely weakening of rupee will partially blunt the impact of higher tariffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the report emphasizes that indirect impact of a global trade war could be more significant through weaker overall exports, investment and consumption sentiment, and currency volatility. India&rsquo;s domestic-driven economy provides some resilience, with exports accounting for 21% of GDP in FY24. In contrast, some other Asian economies, such as Thailand, have a much larger export dependency, with exports accounting for around 60% of GDP. Nevertheless, broader global uncertainties could weigh on Indian economy.&nbsp;CareEdge Ratings projects a slight widening of India&#39;s Current Account Deficit (CAD) to 1.1% of GDP in FY26 due to a slowdown in global trade stemming from trade tensions. While goods exports may face headwinds, resilient services exports and favorable crude oil prices (assumed Brent at USD 65-75/barrel for FY26) should mitigate the impact.&nbsp;In simple terms, the growing trade tensions between countries, especially between the United States and others, are starting to affect India. Here&rsquo;s how it could impact India:&nbsp;Risk of Higher Tariffs on Indian Goods: India sells a lot of goods to the United States, and the U.S. has been putting higher taxes (called tariffs) on goods coming from other countries like China, Mexico, and Canada. India could also face higher tariffs from the U.S. because India sells more goods to the U.S. than it buys from them, and U.S. tariffs on Indian goods are already higher than the tariffs India charges on American products. If the U.S. raises these tariffs by another 8%, India could lose around $3 billion in exports. But this loss would only make up a small part (about 0.1%) of India&rsquo;s overall economy.&nbsp;Weaker Exports and Slower Growth: Beyond the direct impact of tariffs, India&rsquo;s overall exports (goods and services) could suffer because of global trade issues. If the global economy slows down, countries may buy less from India. This can also affect Indian businesses, investment, and even consumer spending.&nbsp;Current Account Deficit (CAD) Could Widen: India may also see a slight increase in its current account deficit (CAD). This is the gap between the money India earns from exports and the money it spends on imports. For FY26, this gap could widen to about 1.1% of India&rsquo;s total economic output. However, services like IT exports and lower oil prices could help reduce the negative effects.&nbsp;Pressure on the Indian Rupee (INR): The Indian rupee has been losing value against the U.S. dollar, partly because foreign investors have been pulling their money out of Indian markets. If the rupee keeps weakening, it will make imports more expensive and could add pressure on India&rsquo;s economy. Experts at CareEdge Rating predict that the rupee might weaken even more in the coming years, though the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may step in to try to stabilize it.&nbsp;CareEdge Ratings projects the USD/INR exchange rate to depreciate further to around 88-89 by FY26 amidst global uncertainties. However, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to intervene to limit excessive volatility.&nbsp;Possible Interest Rate Cuts: To support the economy and boost growth, the Reserve Bank of India might reduce interest rates (the cost of borrowing money) by 0.25% to 0.50% in the next year. This could make loans cheaper and encourage more spending and investment.&nbsp;",

The MCX Silver May contract at ₹101,048 was up 1.58 per cent.&nbsp;Tariff development:The US President Trump signed an order to implement a 25 per cent tariff on auto imports, effective from April 3, which will initially target fully assembled vehicles. The President threatened Canada and the European Union (EU) with more tariffs should they work together to do economic harm to the US. He said that tariffs will be permanent with no exceptions.

Exclusion zone for this reactor is not beyond plant boundary,&quot; Singh said.&nbsp;&quot;These reactors are suitable for providing energy for remote as well as off-grid locations with the objective to decarbonise the energy sector,&quot; the minister said.&nbsp;Singh said the conceptual design of the Indian Gas Cooled Reactor (IGCR) (5 MWth) was being carried out. &quot;The high-temperature reactor will be coupled with plant utilising thermo-chemical process for demonstration of hydrogen production for decarbonisation of transport sector and process industries,&quot; he said.&nbsp;Singh said demonstration units of these reactors are planned to be installed at Department of Atomic Energy sites.&nbsp;&quot;These demonstration reactors are likely to be constructed in 60 to 72 months after receipt of project sanctions,&quot; he said.Singh said the Rs 20,000 crore allocated in Union Budget-2025 was for the development of five indigenous SMRs by 2033.&nbsp;",

The parents of the minors, who indulged in any such activity, were also called and they were left after proper counselling, he added.A weekly report of the actions taken by the squad will be prepared every week on Monday, said another police officer, adding each district will form at least two squads, which will be supervised by the ACP, Crime Against Women Cell, of the concerned district.Each squad will comprise an inspector, a sub-inspector, four female officers, five male officers and one personnel from special staff from the anti-auto theft squad for technical assistance, said a circular issued by the police commissioner.They will be provided with one four-wheeler and adequate two-wheelers to ensure effective patrolling and quick response. The squad will also routinely move around in vulnerable areas and conduct drives in at least two vulnerable points every day.Plain-clothed female officers will be deployed to identify offenders and surprise checks will be conducted in public transport with outreach to the DTC staff and passengers to encourage reporting.The BJP had in the Delhi Assembly elections manifesto promised to establish Anti-Romeo squad&#39;, as in Uttar Pradesh, to enhance women&#39;s safety in public spaces.This initiative by the Delhi Police adopts a multi-faceted approach, involving prevention, intervention and victim assistance.",

Tencent is valuing this subsidiary unit at about 4 billion Euros (Approximately 4.3 billion USD).&nbsp;Notably, Tencent already owns about 10 per cent of Ubisoft, with the founding Guillemot family owning 15 per cent. This new acquisition of 25 per cent stake in the subsidiary unit is poised to make Tencent a prominent voice in Ubisoft.&nbsp;Ubisoft, while announcing this development, said that they will &quot;focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platform.&rdquo; It added: &ldquo;With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises&rsquo; long-term growth and success.&rdquo;&nbsp;In the press release, Ubisoft also said: &quot;Backed by greater investment and boosted creative capacities, it will drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features.&quot;&nbsp;As per Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft&rsquo;s co-founder and chief executive, this deal marks a &ldquo;new chapter&rdquo; for the Paris-based company as it strives to create &ldquo;evergreen, growing&rdquo; games.ALSO READ:&nbsp;Vivo X200 Ultra launching in April, X200s may tag along: What to expectUbisoft&rsquo;s shares fall in past one year&nbsp;Over the past year, Ubisoft&rsquo;s stock has declined by more than 33 per cent, bringing its market valuation down to 1.7 billion Euros.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the company saw a slight boost last week following the long-awaited release of the latest Assassin&rsquo;s Creed installment&mdash;previously postponed&mdash;it wasn&#39;t enough to offset the overall downturn.&nbsp;This investment from Tencent is expected to help Ubisoft shore up its balance sheet.&nbsp;According to a report by the Financial Times, Tencent has earlier showed interest in gaining more control over Ubisoft&rsquo;s operations. The report quoted Tencent president Martin Lau as saying: &ldquo;We see the immense potential for these franchises to evolve into long-term evergreen game platforms and create engaging new experiences for gamers.&rdquo;",

    "body": "By Edwin Chan&nbsp;Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has released a new artificial intelligence model in its Qwen series that the company says can process text, pictures, audio and video, and is efficient enough to run directly on mobile phones and laptops.&nbsp;The company said it expects that the new model, now publicly available on Hugging Face and GitHub, will be used to build so-called AI agents that can, for example, help a visually impaired person navigate their environment through real-time audio descriptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alibaba has been releasing AI products at a frenetic pace since going all-in on the technology this year. The ecommerce and cloud computing leader in China came out with a different version of its Qwen model just days after DeepSeek made waves in January. And earlier this month, it unveiled a new version of its AI assistant Quark app.&nbsp;Alibaba is certainly not the only AI developer to make a multimodal model. OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.&rsquo;s Google both offer generative AI tools that process different types of input including text and audio. On Tuesday, OpenAI expanded its capabilities by adding more advanced image generation features to ChatGPT.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alibaba said in a statement that its new Qwen2.5-Omni-7B system demonstrated particularly high performance in speech understanding and generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The internet company co-founded by Jack Ma plans to spend more on its AI and cloud computing network than it has over the past decade. Alibaba envisions becoming a key partner to companies developing and applying AI to the real world as models evolve and need increasing amounts of computing power.&nbsp;Since DeepSeek upstaged OpenAI with a powerful model that purportedly cost just several million dollars to build, China&rsquo;s tech leaders have flooded the market with a rapid succession of low-cost AI services, undercutting premium offerings from the likes of OpenAI and Google.&nbsp;While the jury is out on whether these AI releases match or surpass the most cutting-edge systems from Western AI developers, these newer options are putting more pressure on the business models of leading US companies.",

    "title": "POCO M7 review: A feature-rich budget 5G smartphone good for everyday use",
    "body": "Chinese smartphone brand POCO recently launched in India a budget 5G smartphone, the POCO M7. Starting at Rs 10,499, the smartphone ticks the right boxed with regard to performance and features. It is a common assumption that smartphones in the budget segment won&rsquo;t ideally have impressive cameras but things might look different with POCO M7 5G. Let us find out if it fares well in the day-to-day operations or not.&nbsp;Design&nbsp;The POCO M7 5G features a flat frame with rounded edges, seamlessly adjusting in users&#39; hands, especially if they are gamers who like to stay hooked to the smartphone for hours. The rounded edges won&rsquo;t make you feel any discomfort, but the large display form factor make it feel like you are holding a brick.&nbsp;The POCO M7 5G sports a dual-tone design on the back with the lower side offering a matte finish and the upper half sporting a glossy finish. It creates an eye-catching effect but, as expected, the glossy finish makes it a fingerprint magnet and prone to smudges.&nbsp;One of the most noticeable or should I say unmissable aspect of POCO M7 5G is its gigantic camera island, which makes it look like it is housing four camera sensors but, in reality, it doesn&rsquo;t. The huge display and large bezels, especially the lower one, make it look heavy but it weighs 205.39 g and measures 8.22mm in thickness.&nbsp;On the upper left side, there&rsquo;s a dual-SIM tray with a separate slot for a microSD card. On the right side, there&rsquo;s a power button along with the volume rocker. At the top, it has a 3.5mm headphone jack, something that&rsquo;s becoming uncommon in newer smartphones, and if one is a fan of wired earphones like I am, then this will be a treat for them. At the bottom, there&rsquo;s a USB Type-C port, microphone, and speaker.&nbsp;ALSO READ | Apple iPhone 17: 5 major changes expected from &#39;Pro models&#39; in the series&nbsp;Display and Audio&nbsp;The POCO M7 5G is claimed to offer the biggest screen in this price segment. The smartphone sports a 6.88-inch HD+(720p resolution) LCD display of 120Hz refresh rate and up to 600 nits of peak brightness. Despite sporting an LCD panel, the colours on the screen are punchy and vibrant.&nbsp;It offers good viewing angles and contrast ratio; however, had the huge bezels not been there, this device would have offered an impressive viewing experience. The high refresh rate is capable of handling games like Temple Run, 8 Ball Pool, and Candy Crush efficiently.&nbsp;Coming to the audio, the loudness is quite apt but as for the clarity, it wasn&rsquo;t that great. Other smartphones in this price segment have offered better audio clarity.&nbsp;Camera&nbsp;The POCO M7 5G has a single 50MP (Sony IMX852) primary sensor of f/1.8 aperture on the rear sie and an 8MP camera on the front. Both the main camera and the selfie camera can record up to 1080p videos at 30fps. The humongous camera island and the lenses have left me with mixed feelings.&nbsp;If the lighting is adequate and it&#39;s a bright sunny day then the POCO M7 5G will be able to capture decent pictures. Shots will have details and clarity in sunlight but in low-light conditions, the smartphone will struggle a bit to capture as clear pictures as it would during the daytime. The night mode then attempts to save the day but isn&rsquo;t able to have much success.&nbsp;ALSO READ |&nbsp;Soon, WhatsApp will let you share &#39;motion photos&#39; captured on Android phone&nbsp;The same story is applicable to the front camera. If the lighting condition is adequate then users will be able to capture slightly above-average pictures (thanks to the 8MP lens). However, as the light starts to dim, users will end up with blurred and hazy images that would make them question their decision to click a selfie. Additionally, if users attempt to capture something while even walking slowly then videos will turn out far better than pictures as the image stabilisation here is missing.&nbsp;POCO claimed that the device features a 50MP AI camera but apart from a few filters, AI was not able to work its magic on the POCO M7 5G. The zoom-in capacity is decent. The smartphone offers up to 10x zoom levels, with a fair amount of details being captured in shots up to 2x zoom level. The 50MP mode fares slightly better than the normal photo or portrait mode. Overall, it would be safe to say that given the price segment of this smartphone, the cameras have performed well.&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;The POCO M7 5G is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 4 Gen 2, paired with up to 8GB LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB UFS 2.2 storage, which can be expanded up to 1TB via microSD.&nbsp;Throughout the review, the POCO M7 delivered a consistently smooth experience during everyday activities. Apps loaded quickly, multitasking between various apps felt seamless, and tasks like web browsing, using the camera, scrolling through social media, or streaming videos on YouTube were handled effortlessly.&nbsp;Considering the price range, this is quite impressive. The smartphone is easily able to handle light multitasking including gaming and multimedia viewing. Notably, if users play too demanding games then they will notice heating issues kicking in.&nbsp;Software&nbsp;The POCO M7 boots Xiaomi&rsquo;s Hyper OS, based on Android 14. POCO has promised two major Android updates, meaning users can expect updates up to Android 16, along with security patches for four years. While four years of security support is impressive for this price range, it would have been nicer if the phone had launched with Android 15 instead.&nbsp;The software includes several useful tools. Users get a &lsquo;Dual Apps&rsquo; feature, allowing two separate logins within the same application, an &lsquo;App Lock&rsquo; for added privacy, and a &lsquo;Game Turbo&rsquo; which is designed to enhance gaming performance by blocking interruptions and prioritising resources. Additionally, there&rsquo;s a built-in &lsquo;Security&rsquo; app to clear junk files, scan for malware, and improve device performance by freeing up memory.&nbsp;ALSO READ |&nbsp;Poco F7 Pro and F7 Ultra to debut globally on March 27: What to expect&nbsp;There is also one major downside to this smartphone, the heavy presence of pre-installed apps, annoying ads, and frequent spam notifications. Many games come pre-loaded, and the built-in app store (GetApps) tries aggressively to prompt users into installing more. Ads are scattered across the user interface&mdash;including the app drawer&rsquo;s search bar and the system apps updater. Even apps like &lsquo;Themes&rsquo; regularly push notifications. Thankfully most of these unwanted elements can be disabled.&nbsp;Battery and charging&nbsp;The POCO M7 5G is powered by a 5,160 mAh battery, supporting 18W fast charging. Interestingly, POCO includes a faster 33W charger in the box.&nbsp;Charging from zero to full takes a little over two hours, which is okay for a smartphone in a budget segment. Once fully charged, the battery can easily last for up to a day with light to moderate usage.&nbsp;Verdict&nbsp;The POCO M7 5G is a decent phone that you can consider as a daily driver, if the usage is limited to essential tasks. If someone is looking for a valued proposition that they can rely on, is good for calling, some video streaming, and listening to music or playing casual games like Candy Crush then this smartphone might be the right pick.",

    "title": "Apple iPhone 16e review: Expensive no-frill iPhone with focus on essentials",
    "body": "The iPhone 16e is a new addition to the iPhone 16 series, which Apple said is designed from the ground up to support artificial intelligence-powered features under the Apple Intelligence branding. Priced from Rs 59,900, it sits on the expensive side of the spectrum despite its focus on essentials. However, it warrants consideration for its compact form factor, ease of use, and all-day battery life.&nbsp;Design and Display&nbsp;The iPhone 16e features a compact design complemented by a thin and lightweight yet durable construction. It has an aluminium frame, ceramic glass protection on the display, and an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. However, the design is uninspiring, closely resembling the iPhone 14, with the only notable addition being the action button from the latest iPhone line-up. Even the colour options are limited to black and white.&nbsp;While these features compensate for some aspects, they do not address all shortcomings. The display is bordered by thick bezels and a relatively large notch at the top, housing the Face ID sensors and front-facing camera. Moreover, the 60Hz OLED panel feels dated, particularly for users accustomed to higher refresh rate displays. This is not unique to the iPhone 16e, as both the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus also feature 60Hz screens. The difference is immediately noticeable when transitioning from a higher refresh rate display, resulting in an underwhelming visual experience.&nbsp;ALSO READ |&nbsp;Google Pixel 9a: Here&#39;s what to expect from upcoming Apple iPhone 16e rival&nbsp;Audio&nbsp; Fortunately, Apple has maintained a high standard in the audio department. The iPhone 16e delivers clear and loud acoustics, with support for spatial audio over wireless connections when used with compatible accessories.&nbsp;Camera&nbsp;The iPhone 16e adheres to its essentials-focused philosophy in the imaging department as well. It features a single 48-megapixel rear camera that performs well in good lighting but struggles in low-light conditions, likely due to a slower shutter speed&mdash;a limitation not observed in other models within the iPhone 16 series.&nbsp;The camera interface offers 1x and 2x zoom options, indicating optical zoom availability. However, the 2x zoom is achieved through in-sensor cropping rather than dedicated hardware. This method works effectively in well-lit conditions but underperforms in low-light environments. Portrait photography is a mixed experience&mdash;while it works well for human subjects, it fails to detect non-human objects accurately due to the absence of a secondary camera or additional depth sensors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensor limitations also impact video quality, especially in low-light scenarios. However, in well-lit conditions, the iPhone 16e records impressive 4K videos in Dolby Vision at 60 frames per second, offering excellent stabilisation, wide colour coverage, a superior dynamic range, and spatial audio support.&nbsp;Performance and AI features&nbsp;&nbsp; Powered by the Apple A18 chip &ndash; based on the processor found in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus &ndash; the iPhone 16e features a 6-core CPU, 4-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The chipset also introduces the Apple C1 5G modem, which enhances power efficiency without compromising network performance.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Get iPhone in 10 mins: Zepto joins qcommerce race to deliver Apple products&nbsp;While Apple Intelligence is a key feature of the A18 chip, it is currently unavailable in India. The AI-powered functionalities are set to roll out with iOS 18.4 in April. In terms of general performance, the A18 delivers a balance of power and efficiency, handling everyday tasks as well as intensive workloads with ease. However, thermal management is a concern&mdash;the device heats up quickly during demanding tasks such as recording 4K 60fps videos or playing graphically intensive games. Additionally, it warms up noticeably while charging, which leads to reduced performance and longer charging times.&nbsp;Battery and charging&nbsp; The iPhone 16e supports both wired and wireless charging, but it does not feature MagSafe compatibility. Charging times exceed an hour for both methods. However, battery life is a strong point for this compact device, offering six to seven hours of screen-on time depending on usage. Impressively, it does not require frequent recharges, making it a reliable choice for users who prioritise longevity in a compact smartphone.&nbsp;Verdict&nbsp; The iPhone 16e is a well-rounded device that balances essential features with a compact design and reliable battery life. While it excels in areas such as audio quality and everyday performance, it falls short with its outdated 60Hz display, thermal issues, and camera limitations in low light. For those seeking an iPhone experience without premium features at a relatively lower price, the iPhone 16e is a viable option&mdash;though not without compromises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A post shared by BSTech (@bstechofficial)",

    "title": "Nothing Phone 3a review: A mid-ranger with something in store for everyone",
    "body": "Nothing debuted the A-series in 2024 with focus on the essentials, but most importantly to deliver a strong value-for-money proposition in the midrange segment. The philosophy stands true for the recently launched Phone 3a Pro, which I recently reviewed and you can read it here. But what about the standard Phone 3a? It shares key specifications with the Pro model, including the processor, display, and battery, but comes at a lower price. While the base model has the potential to outperform its Pro counterpart in value, does it have missing features that may impact everyday performance? Let us find out:&nbsp;Design&nbsp;The Nothing Phone 3a has a distinct design compared to the Pro model but feels like a true successor to last year&rsquo;s Phone 2a. It retains the centrally aligned horizontal camera layout, now upgraded to a triple-camera setup. The phone also carries Nothing&rsquo;s signature transparent back with the Glyph interface, along with improvements to the back panel&mdash;most notably, the new glass material, which is more resistant to scratches than its predecessor. Additionally, the base variant offers more colour options.&nbsp;Despite being significantly lighter than the Pro model, the Phone 3a still has some heft, weighing 201g. However, its well-balanced weight distribution ensures a comfortable grip during extended use. The phone also sits flatter on surfaces due to a less protruding camera module while maintaining stability for tabletop use. That said, some common issues remain&mdash;it is slightly slippery and prone to smudges.&nbsp;One of the key upgrades this year is the introduction of the Essential Key, positioned below the side-mounted power button. Like the Pro model, it has a convex shape and glossy finish, making it distinct from the other buttons. Its placement ensures easy accessibility while minimizing the chances of mistaking it for the power button.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Xiaomi 15 series with Leica-tuned cameras launched in India: Check pricing&nbsp;Display&nbsp;The Nothing Phone 3a features the same 6.77-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display as the Pro model, delivering vibrant colours and sharp visuals. It offers a peak manual brightness of 800 nits, which increases to 1300 nits in high-brightness mode for improved outdoor visibility. The display also maintains good legibility with minimal glare across different viewing angles.&nbsp;While it lacks an LTPO panel, the Phone 3a dynamically adjusts its refresh rate between 30Hz, 60Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz based on usage. Scrolling and animations feel smooth, and in Gaming Mode, the 1000Hz touch sampling rate ensures precise touch response for enhanced gameplay.&nbsp;For media consumption, the device supports Widevine L1 certification, enabling high-definition playback on compatible platforms. YouTube videos offer HDR viewing options, but HDR support is not available on streaming services like Netflix.&nbsp;Camera&nbsp;There are significant differences between the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro in the camera department, but first, let&rsquo;s look at the similarities. On paper, both smartphones feature a 50MP (f/1.88) primary camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS). However, in actual use, there are noticeable differences in image processing. The Phone 3a captures images with a slightly warmer tone, while the Pro model produces more vibrant colours under the same settings. Despite this, details and sharpness remain consistent across both devices. The smartphones also share an 8MP ultra-wide camera, where colour variations between the two models are less pronounced.&nbsp;The major distinction lies in the telephoto camera. The Phone 3a is equipped with a 50MP telephoto lens capable of 2x optical zoom, whereas the Pro model features a periscope setup enabling 3x optical zoom. The Phone 3a captures good detail at 2x zoom, but images become less sharp when zooming further compared to the Pro. That said, the Phone 3a&rsquo;s telephoto camera performs better in bright conditions, being less prone to overexposure. Additionally, it produces better portraits at 2x zoom, whereas the Pro excels at 3x.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Nothing Phone 3a goes on sale with introductory offers: Check details here&nbsp;Another key difference is the front-facing camera. The Phone 3a has a 32MP sensor, while the Pro boasts a 50MP unit. While selfies on the Phone 3a are decent and usable, facial details can appear over-softened in low-light conditions.&nbsp;For videography, both the primary and telephoto cameras support 4K at 30fps. However, the ultra-wide camera is limited to 1080p at 30fps. The front camera also lacks 4K recording but does support 1080p at 60fps.&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Both the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset. However, the base model does not offer a 12GB RAM option. Despite this, there is little difference in real-world performance, as the Phone 3a handles day-to-day tasks smoothly.&nbsp;For more demanding workloads such as multitasking and gaming, the device performs well, though graphically intensive games require some compromises. While these games remain playable, reducing graphics settings to medium is necessary to maintain stable performance. Additionally, there is a noticeable rise in temperature near the camera bar during extended gaming sessions. That said, I did not experience any frame drops while playing Genshin Impact, despite the warmth.&nbsp;Software&nbsp;Just like the Pro model, the user interface on the Phone 3a feels nearly flagship-grade. Running on Android 15-based Nothing OS 3.1, the software experience is clean, free of bloatware, and non-intrusive. The interface is fluid, with smooth animations throughout the system.&nbsp;Notably, the Phone 3a retains all the software features of the Pro model. This includes interactive and engaging widgets, lock screen customisation options, and AI-powered functionalities such as automatic app drawer sorting. It also introduces the new Essential Space, which, in some ways, resembles Google Pixel&rsquo;s Screenshot app but offers expanded functionality. Users can add notes to captures, save and transcribe audio notes, and more. The feature can also understand the content of the images and set reminders for an event if it detects details for one. While there are some minor inconsistencies in the software, these are likely to be addressed in future updates.&nbsp;Battery and charging&nbsp;Battery and charging on the Phone 3a are identical to the Pro model, featuring a 5000mAh battery with support for 50W wired charging. On a full charge, the phone comfortably lasts an entire day and extends into the following hours. Interestingly, during testing, the Phone 3a lasted slightly longer than the Pro. As for charging speeds, the device recharges fully in approximately 55 minutes.&nbsp;Verdict&nbsp;Priced at Rs 24,999, the Phone 3a presents strong value for those seeking a well-rounded daily driver. It delivers sufficient power for routine tasks, captures decent photos, offers excellent battery life, and maintains a refined software experience. The absence of features like wireless charging is less noticeable at this price point. However, for those needing greater versatility in the camera department, the Phone 3a Pro would be the better choice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A post shared by BSTech (@bstechofficial)",

    "title": "Lava's Prowatch X review: Capable smartwatch for health tracking on budget",
    "body": "Lava&rsquo;s sub brand Prowatch has launched its Prowatch X smartwatch, offering some advanced health and fitness tracking features that are generally not associated with budget watches. This includes Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measurement, Body Energy score, built-in GPS for tracking outdoor activities and more. In addition to this the company claims the Prowatch X to be very accurate in collecting data. So how is the Prowatch X different from its competitors, and can it actually give more premium watches a run for their money? Let us find out:&nbsp;Design&nbsp;Lava&rsquo;s Prowatch X sports a sleek aluminum alloy casing with a flat display that subtly curves near the bezels. The sensors on the underside are tucked-in well enough to ensure a comfortable fit. While the bottom panel is made of plastic, it does not give off a low-quality feel. Lava offers three strap choices&mdash;Silicone, Nylon, and Metal. Though I was unable to test the Metal strap, both the Silicone and Nylon options feel sturdy. The watch remains lightweight with these straps, and the Nylon band, in particular, is highly breathable, making it comfortable for all-day wear.&nbsp;That said, there are a few drawbacks. The pin mechanism for attaching straps is not the most user-friendly and might take a few minutes to secure. Additionally, users with smaller wrists may find the dial slightly large.&nbsp;Also Read: Apple delays advanced Siri features due to intelligence setback: Know more&nbsp;Display&nbsp;The display is one of the standout features of the Prowatch X. Its 1.43-inch AMOLED panel delivers sharp and clear visuals. While the bezels are on the thicker side, it offers ample real estate to play with. Additionally, the display can be cranked up to impressive brightness levels, ensuring visibility outdoors from nearly all angles. The 60Hz refresh rate is also enough to ensure a smooth scrolling experience on the watch. The watch supports always-on display (AOD) functionality as well, though the selection of standby watch faces for this feature is limited.&nbsp;Additionally, the display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which helps resist scratches and scuffs.&nbsp;Health and fitness tracking&nbsp;The Prowatch X offers a comprehensive set of health monitoring features, including heart rate monitoring, SpO2 tracking, and VO2 Max measurement. Additionally, continuous heart rate tracking enables Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measurement, while SpO2 can also be monitored continuously during activity tracking. In terms of accuracy, I found minimal discrepancies between the Prowatch X and some premium smartwatches when counting steps or measuring heart rate and SpO2 levels&mdash;an impressive performance.&nbsp;Beyond these capabilities, the watch includes stress monitoring, sleep tracking, and a &ldquo;Body Energy&rdquo; metric. While its sleep tracking provides fairly accurate insights, it does not activate automatically and must be enabled manually. The Body Energy feature evaluates HRV, stress, sleep, and activity levels to generate an energy score. If the watch detects movement when energy levels are low, it sends a prompt suggesting rest.&nbsp;For activity tracking, the Prowatch X offers multiple modes that cover most common sports and exercises. While it does not provide highly detailed analytics, the continuous heart rate tracking directly on the watch is a useful addition. It also features built-in GPS for tracking outdoor running and walking. However, automatic activity detection sometimes takes time to activate.&nbsp;Companion app and features&nbsp;The watch syncs with smartphones via the Prospot app, which presents metrics in a widget-based layout for easy navigation and quick access to data. The Exercise Record section provides a reasonable amount of data per session. Despite its strengths, some drawbacks exist. Occasional pairing issues arise where the watch remains connected to the phone, yet fails to sync data, requiring re-pairing. Additionally, while updating the watch, the app sometimes displays a failed update message due to insufficient charge, even when the battery level is well above the required threshold.&nbsp;The watch also includes practical tools such as an Ambient Sound Monitor, which displays environmental noise levels in decibels. Additionally, it features a built-in barometer and compass, useful for hikers. These are in addition to standard functions like notifications, call answering, an integrated dialer, and more.The microphone effectively captures voice during calls in quieter environments, while the speakers are sufficiently loud for clear conversations.&nbsp;Battery and charging&nbsp;Battery life is another key highlight of the Prowatch X. The company claims a backup of up to 10 days, which largely holds true in real-world use. During my testing, the watch required charging only once a week, even with notifications, Bluetooth calling, heart rate monitoring, and regular activity tracking enabled. However, using GPS tracking for outdoor walks and running sessions causes the battery to drain more quickly.&nbsp;For charging, the watch includes a USB-A to two-pin magnetic connector cable in the box, but there are some drawbacks. The cable feels somewhat flimsy and is relatively short. Additionally, the magnets lack strength, making it difficult to keep the watch in place while charging, especially since it cannot lay flat on a surface for added stability.&nbsp;Verdict&nbsp;At Rs 4,499, the Lava&rsquo;s Prowatch X is a strong contender in the budget smartwatch segment. It delivers accurate data tracking, a comprehensive set of health and fitness features, and a design that balances comfort with style. While some software aspects could benefit from further refinement, these can likely be improved through future software updates. Overall, the Prowatch X ranks among the best affordable smartwatches currently available.",

    "body": "Logistics services company, Rapid Fleet Management, made a positive debut on the NSE SME platform on Friday, March 28, 2025. The stock listed at ₹195 per share on the NSE SME, up 1.56 per cent from the IPO issue price of ₹192.&nbsp;Ahead of the listing, unlisted shares of Rapid Fleet Management IPO were trading flat at ₹192 in the grey market, according to the sources tracking unofficial markets.&nbsp;Rapid Fleet Management IPO was a book-built issue of ₹43.87 crore, comprising a fresh issue of 2.28 million equity shares. The price band was set in the range of ₹183 to ₹192 per share.&nbsp;Rapid Fleet Management IPO detailsThe SME IPO had opened for subscription on Friday, March 21, 2025, and closed on Tuesday, March 25, 2025, garnering a decent response from investors, with the issue being oversubscribed 1.65 times.&nbsp;Retail investors subscribed to only 81 per cent of the reserved quota, while non-institutional investors (NIIs) subscribed to the IPO by 4.38 times.

    "title": "FY25 mop up at ₹1.72 trn: Will FY26 be another blockbuster year for IPOs?",
    "body": "Financial year 2024-25 (FY25) saw a total of 318 companies, comprising 79 mainline and 239 SME, raise ₹1.72 trillion in initial public offerings (IPOs), surpassing the combined total raised in the last two fiscals, FY24 and FY23.&nbsp;Notably, the amount raised in FY25 is nearly two and a half times greater than the ₹73,628.23 crore raised in FY24 and over three times the ₹54,856.53 crore raised in FY23, data suggests.&nbsp;The mainline segment alone, consisting of 79 companies, raised ₹1.62 trillion, which is still 26 per cent higher than the combined total of ₹1.28 trillion raised by 437 companies in FY23 and FY24 (including both mainline and SME).&nbsp; Financial YearTotal No. of IPOsNo. of mainline IPOsAmount raised by mainlinesNo. of SME IPOsAmount raised by SMEsTotal amount raisedFY2531879₹ 1,62,517.21 Cr239₹ 9,966.91 Cr₹ 1,72,484.12 CrFY2427378₹ 67,557.63 Cr195₹ 6,070.4 Cr₹ 73,628.23 CrFY2316439₹ 52,549.1 Cr125₹ 2,307.43 Cr₹ 54,856.53 CrAnalysts attribute this success in the primary markets to the remarkable performance of secondary markets for most part of FY25.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, there is a positive correlation between the IPO market and the secondary market. &quot;When the secondary markets do well, the primary markets also get a rub-off effect. The boom in the Indian stock market post the Covid crash facilitated a boom in the IPO market as well,&quot; Vijayakumar added.&nbsp;Echoing similar views, Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst also feels that the secondary market sentiment has a bearing on the primary markets. Another factor investors consider, he said, is when companies go public at a decent premium.&nbsp;&ldquo;If the issue gets listed at a discount, long-term investors would prefer to buy the stocks post-listing at a cheaper price. Given the fact that some issues offered solid returns post-listing, the primary markets witnessed enthusiastic participation from investors in FY25,&quot; Baliga said.&nbsp;Notably, the benchmark Indian equity indices, BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty50, scaled their historic peaks of 85,978.25 and 26,277.35, respectively, in September, 2024.&nbsp;This extraordinary bullishness in the secondary markets, along with some themes like small finance banks, new-age companies, digital companies, stock market-related companies, renewable energy, and green energy, according to G Chokkalingam, Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Equinomics Research, have led to the boom in the primary market in FY25.&nbsp;Also Read: Investment guide: Where to invest in FY26? Analysts pick sectors to bet&nbsp; Will the trend continue in FY26?&nbsp;&nbsp;Market analysts remain divided on the outlook of primary markets in FY26. Notably, as many as 49 companies have already received approval from the capital market regulatory body, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), to raise a combined total of up to ₹84,069.00 crore, according to PRIME Database data. In addition, 67 companies have filed their draft papers with Sebi to raise nearly ₹1trillion.&nbsp;The road ahead for the primary markets in FY26, said Narendra Solanki, head of fundamental research - Investment Services at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers will largely depend on how the secondary markets play out.&nbsp;Chokkalingam, on the other hand, said that a full recovery in the secondary markets is still awaited.&nbsp;&ldquo;A number of stocks that recently got listed are witnessing a steep correction given the overall market sentiment. While we may see companies approach the markets to list, I remain skeptical if FY26 will be a blockbuster year for the primary markets,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;If there is a recovery in the secondary markets, and the initial couple of public issues get listed at a decent premium, primary markets, Baliga believes, could well be on course for a revival in the fiscal year ahead.&nbsp;",

    "title": "Missed the IPO bus? Time to buy selectively for the long-term, say analysts",
    "body": "It has been a turbulent few months for the Indian stock markets that saw the frontline indices, the S&P BSE Sensex and the Nifty 50 slip over 10 per cent from their peak levels hit in September 2024.&nbsp;The nervousness also took a toll on stocks of debutants at the exchanges with 57, or 72 per cent of the 79 companies that listed on the exchanges through mainboard IPOs in FY25 trading below their listing price as of March 24, 2025. Data shows that 45 per cent (36 out of 79) of these stocks are now below their respective issue prices.&nbsp;So, why are these stocks struggling?&nbsp;Analysts suggest that the primary factor behind this widespread correction in the stocks of companies that have recently listed is their expensive valuations.&nbsp;Prashanth Tapse, senior vice-president for research at Mehta Equities says that many IPOs listed at expensive valuations, which seemed justified at the time due to strong liquidity amid a bullish market.&nbsp;&ldquo;However, as the broader market weakened, particularly in midcap and small-cap segments, these elevated valuations proved unsustainable,&rdquo; Tapse added.&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of IPOs deteriorated notably in the second half of FY25. Since October 1, 2024, 40 IPOs have hit Dalal Street, raising over ₹1.11 trillion, data suggests. Out of these, 28 stocks are below their listing prices, while 18 are below their issue prices as per the latest available data.&nbsp;Even some of the highly anticipated IPOs such as Hyundai Motor India, Ola Electric, Swiggy and state-run NTPC Green Energy have struggled post-listing.&nbsp;Weak corporate earnings back home, correction in broader markets and global uncertainties, too, analysts believe, took a toll on the sentiment, dragging the stocks of new-listed firms along.&nbsp;&ldquo;Many IPOs in FY25 benefitted from the overall bullish market sentiment,&rdquo; said Rajnath Yadav, senior analyst at Choice Broking. &ldquo;However, in the second half, geopolitical tensions and broader market weakness led to reduced retail participation, making it harder for IPOs to sustain their gains,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second chance&nbsp;Given the fall, analysts believe there are some attractive opportunities emerging, and for those who missed the IPO wave, this correction could provide a second chance.&nbsp;Aditya Kondawar, Partner and Vice President at Complete Circle Capital said the market correction has sifted weaker companies, leaving stocks of fundamentally strong businesses across sectors less bruised, which presents a valuable buying opportunity.&nbsp;Echoing similar views, &ldquo;some stocks have now reached reasonable valuation levels,&rdquo; said Tapse, who recommends looking at Emcure Pharma, Niva Bupa, and Afcons Infrastructure as potential buys for the long-term.&nbsp;Yadav suggests investors should target sectors with strong growth prospects. &ldquo;By following this approach, they can identify shares aligned with high-growth industries. As the market and these sectors expand, the share prices of companies in these spaces are likely to recover and grow,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;For investors who missed the initial IPO frenzy, the market correction is an opportunity to selectively invest in promising names, but patience and careful evaluation remain the key.",

Failing to do so will restrain FVCIs from making any new investments.&quot;Existing FVCIs shall engage a DDP, to avail its services for conducting due diligence with respect to continuance of registration as an FVCI, by March 31, 2025.&quot;Any FVCI failing to engage a DDP by March 31, 2025, shall not be permitted to make any further investment and shall liquidate investments in listed securities, by March 31, 2026 and other investments, by March 31, 2027,&quot; Sebi said in its circular.Proceeds from these sales are required to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT) rules.The guidelines also mandate that DDPs conduct eligibility checks on FVCIs within six months of engagement.

    "title": "Sebi amends rules, introduces fixed price process for voluntary delisting",
    "body": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has notified critical changes in the delisting regulations, providing promoters better chances to take their firms private through a fixed price framework.&nbsp;The regulator has also introduced new norms to facilitate the delisting of investment holding companies (holdcos).&nbsp;In addition to the reverse book building process, Sebi has introduced a fixed price process where promoters can offer to buy back all shares from the public at least 15 per cent premium to its &ldquo; fair price&rdquo;.&ldquo;In case the acquirer has proposed delisting through a fixed price process; the acquirer shall provide a fixed delisting price which shall be at least 15 per cent more than the floor price calculated in terms of regulation 19A,&rdquo; as per the notification dated September 25.Further, the acquirer will be eligible for delisting through a fixed price process only if the shares of the company are frequently traded.&ldquo;This new regime gives existing promoters an option to delist their entities at a fixed price with a 15 per cent premium to the floor. This is in addition to the already available bidding route (RBB). Whether in a given scenario, one will use the new route or the old one, will have to be assessed based on what the key public shareholders will accept. In many cases, promoters will still opt for RBB, as a counter offer mechanism is available under that route alone,&rdquo; said Gautam Gandotra, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.Sebi has specified metrics for the calculation of the floor price of the equity shares proposed to be delisted through the reverse book building (RBB) process or through the fixed price process.The regulator noted that it should not be less than the highest paid for any acquisition during the 26 weeks preceding the reference date, volume weighted average price paid by an acquirer during 52 weeks preceding the reference date, or adjusted book value, among other criteria.&nbsp;The RBB framework is considered to be very stringent as the delisting price arrived using this process is often quite high, making the offer untenable.Though the amendments have been made effective from September 25, any acquirer may make the delisting offer as per the previous norms till the next two months.Further, Sebi has reduced the threshold under the counter offer mechanism to 75 per cent from 90 per cent of public shareholders.&nbsp;Under the RBB process, the delisting process is considered successful if the post-offer aggregate shareholding of the promoter or the acquirer reaches 90 per cent.&ldquo;In case of delisting through reverse book building process; a counter-offer may be made by the acquirer to the public shareholders, provided the post-offer shareholding of the acquirer, along with the shares tendered by public shareholders, is not less than 75 per cent and not less than 50 per cent of the public shareholding has been tendered,&rdquo; reads the regulation.For delisting of investment holding companies, Sebi specified that to be eligible, the holdco should have at least 75 per cent of its fair value comprising direct investments in equity shares of other listed companies.This fair value will be determined through a joint report by two independent valuers.The market regulator has pointed out that the shares of the holdcos which get delisted will not be permitted to seek relisting for a period of three years from the date of delisting.... simplifies reporting system for participants, launches UDiFF&nbsp;In a move to promote ease of doing business, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has introduced the Unified Distilled File Formats (UDiFF), a standardised reporting system for trading members, clearing members, and depository participants. Previously, these entities had to file over&nbsp;&nbsp;200 proprietary report formats daily with their respective market infrastructure institutions (MIIs). However, Sebi&rsquo;s initiative has reduced this number to just 23 formats, conforming to international ISO standards.&nbsp;The key benefit of this initiative is an estimated savings of Rs 200 crore over five years due to lower operational expenses, Sebi said in a&nbsp; release. UDiFF will also help lower integration costs for new fintechs and make the MII-Member interface interoperable with no additional development costs. The UDiFF implementation was phased, with a parallel run of the existing system for nearly two quarters, ensuring a smooth transition for market participants, the regulator said.&nbsp;",

    "body": "Mutual funds&#39; search for debt fund alternatives has reached the fund of fund (FoF) space with at least two fund houses &mdash; HDFC and Aditya Birla Sun Life (ABSL) &mdash; seeking the regulator&#39;s nod to launch FoFs that can offer debt fund-like returns but with better tax efficiency.Fund houses have been exploring new low-risk product possibilities since the change in taxation in April 2023 when debt funds lost the tax advantage (indexation benefit). Few fund houses like Edelweiss and PPFAS took the hybrid fund route to fill the gap by creating tax-efficient lower-risk products.&nbsp;The change in the tax structure of FoFs in the latest Budget has opened the room for more possibilities.The two proposed products, HDFC Debt Advantage FoF and ABSL Income Optimiser FoF, will invest over 35 per cent of the corpus each in arbitrage funds and debt-oriented schemes. They plan to cap the maximum allocation to the two schemes at less than 65 per cent, according to the fund drafts available on Securities and Exchange Board of India&#39;s (Sebi) website.The launch of the FoFs is subject to approvals from the regulator.FoFs invest in one or multiple MF schemes rather than buying securities directly. According to the new tax rules, FoFs investing less than 65 per cent in debt funds will qualify for long-term capital gains tax benefit i.e., the gains will be taxed at 12.5 per cent if the investor stays invested for more than two years.&quot;Such offerings can find a place in investor portfolios, given the tax advantage. However, much will depend on the debt funds they invest in and how well they are managed. In addition, the expense ratio should be reasonable for the fund to compete with other lower-risk investment options,&quot; said Rushabh Desai, Founder, Rupee With Rushabh.Expense ratios of FoFs are generally higher as investors have to pay expenses for both FoF and its underlying funds.Since the change in debt fund taxation, arbitrage funds have emerged as the preferred debt fund alternative. In the last year, these schemes have raked in over Rs 1 trillion, largely driven by their strong performance and equity taxation.Experts say the proposed FoFs can compete with arbitrage funds, provided they are managed well.&quot;Given the mix of arbitrage and debt allocation, the predictability of returns can be higher in the case of these FoFs compared to pure arbitrage funds,&rdquo; said Rahul Jain, senior vice-president research, International Money Matters.&ldquo;The FoFs will have an added advantage if the fund manager has ample flexibility to shift between various debt funds to make the best out of the prevailing market condition,&quot; Jain said.Other low- to moderate-risk tax-efficient options- Edelweiss Multi Asset Allocation Fund- Parag Parikh Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund- Select schemes in equity savings category",

This growth was driven by increased footfalls and strong performance across brands, concepts, categories, and channels, despite subdued market sentiments and heightened competitive intensity.Analysts at Axis Securities expect strong sales growth to continue in the coming quarters, driven by Trent&#39;s focus on rapid store expansion and ongoing assortment renewal, which should result in increased overall footfall.Additionally, the improvement in the earnings profile across all formats, the reduction in losses at Star Bazaar, and the enhanced traction at the Inditex JV are positive indicators for the company.In recent years, Trent has adopted a small-format store model for Star Food. This approach, coupled with sharp pricing and a focus on fresh produce and private labels, has yielded positive results, the brokerage firm said in Q1FY25 result update.Meanwhile, Trent in its FY24 annual report, said the Indian retail industry is continuing its turnaround momentum with every segment of retail recording strong growth rates. It is projected to expand to $4.5 trillion by the end of the decade, driven by socio-demographic and economic factors such as urbanisation, income growth, a rise in nuclear families, and a shift from the unorganised to the organised segment.India&rsquo;s apparel market is pegged at Rs 6.5 trillion in 2024, with nearly 40 per cent of this represented by organised players.In recent years, private brands have increasingly emerged as the rising stars in the retail and e-commerce segment, the company said..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

    "body": "Sebi on Thursday decided to reduce the timeline for listing of public issue of debt securities to three working days from six days at present, to facilitate faster access to funds.This new timeline will be optional for the first year and mandatory thereafter.&quot;It has been decided to reduce the listing timeline in case of public issue of debt securities and NCRPS to T+3 working days from the existing timeline of T+6 working days,&quot; the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a circular.The move would help in enabling faster access to funds for issuers.Also, the move would align the listing timeline in case of the public issue of debt securities and non-convertible redeemable preference shares (NCRPS) with that of non-convertible securities issued on a private placement basis and specified securities.Further, to ensure ease of compliance for issuers, the listing timeline of T+3 working days will be applicable on a voluntary basis to public issues of debt securities and NCRPS opening on or after November 1, 2024, and on a mandatory basis from November 1, 2025.Earlier this week, Sebi streamlined the application process for public issues of debt securities by asking individual investors applying for amounts up to Rs 5 lakh through intermediaries to use only UPI to block funds.Further, investors will continue to have the choice of availing other methods like applying through Self-Certified Syndicate Banks or the stock exchange platform for making applications.Before that, Sebi amended rules to reduce the period for seeking public comments on the draft offer documents from 7 working days to one day for issuers whose specified securities are already listed and five days for other issuers.Also, the minimum subscription period has been cut from 3 to 2 working days. Further, in case of revision in the price band or yield, the bidding period disclosed in the offer documents, can be extended by one working day instead of three working days..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

    "title": "State Bank of India brought down Kingfisher, Air India: JKC to SC",
    "body": "Lenders of bankrupt airline Jet Airways, led by the State Bank of India (SBI), on Thursday told the Supreme Court that successful bidder Jalan Kalrock Consortium (JKC) was &ldquo;unwilling&rdquo; to pay the dues and that the &ldquo;liquidation&rdquo; was the only option left.The bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud was hearing the SBI-led consortium plea against the NCLAT&rsquo;s March order upholding ownership transfer of the bankrupt airline to JKC.&ldquo;Enough is enough. They can&rsquo;t play with the law. Liquidation is the only option remaining,&rdquo; Additional Solicitor General (ASG) N Venkataraman said.SBI told the court that the total admitted claim of the financial creditor is close to Rs 7,800 crore and the financial package offered by the SRA (Successful Resolution Applicant, that is, JKC) in the Resolution Plan was Rs 4,783 crore, which is payable in tranches in five years.The first tranche payment of Rs 350 crore was required to be made by March 21, 2022. This amount has not been paid to date despite several extensions and exclusions granted to the SRA by the NCLT, NCLAT, and SC.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are struggling for the first tranche of Rs 350 crore. The resolution plan is effective for 180 days. Lenders are incurring Rs 22 crore every month to maintain the Corporate Debtor (Jet Airways),&rdquo; the ASG said.&nbsp;He had also told the court earlier that even the NCLAT&rsquo;s order directing the SRA (to belatedly) create security by mortgaging Dubai properties within 30 days of its order, has not been complied with.Meanwhile, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for JKC, the successful bidder for bankrupt Jet Airways, alleged in the Supreme Court that the SBI brought down Air India and Kingfisher airlines.&ldquo;They have brought down Air India, Kingfisher. Ten separate pleas have been filed by them (SBI) against airlines. Only two airlines are left. They will bring down everything. No airline will remain,&rdquo; Rohatgi alleged in the court.JKC told the court that the lenders do not &quot;give them the key&rdquo; to access their grounded aircraft on the airport premises.&nbsp; &nbsp;The apex court will now hear the arguments by JKC on Tuesday.The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had on March 12 greenlit the transfer of ownership of Jet Airways to JKC.NCLAT had told JKC to obtain an air operator&rsquo;s certificate within 90 days from March 12. It had also given it more time to pay Rs 175 crore to SBI as 107 days had passed since NCLAT&#39;s order allowing the transfer of ownership.It upheld the order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which had permitted the transfer of ownership to JKC in January last year. Consequently, the appeal by the SBI against the takeover of the airline by JKC was dismissed.The lenders then appealed against this order in the Supreme Court.Among the airlines in India, Go First had filed for voluntary insolvency on May 2, 2023, under Section 10 of the IBC, and on May 10, 2023, and the NCLT admitted its insolvency plea.The grounded airline joined the ranks of major carriers such as Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways, which went to the wall in 2012 and 2019, respectively, underscoring the challenges inherent in navigating India&rsquo;s aviation industry.On the other hand, the Tatas took over Air India on January 27, 2022 and chose SBI, Bank of Baroda and HDFC Bank as preferred bankers for the airline. On February 29, 2024, Air India refinanced short-term loans with the SBI and Bank of Baroda (BoB) for a three-year loan, replacing the short-term Rs 18,000 crore bridge loan Air India had availed from SBI and BoB to complete the Tata group&#39;s takeover of the national carrier in January 2022.&nbsp;.storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

He is one of the longest serving expats in Indian aviation who has previously led operations in now defunct carriers including Jet Airways and GoAir.&nbsp;Porqueras had joined IndiGo as Chief of Transformation in April this year. Prior to that, he led operations at Spanish low-cost airline Volotea.

Its domestic market share was 62 per cent as of August 2024.The evolving landscape of Indian airlines has led to the emergence of crucial roles such as the &lsquo;Chief Transformation Officer&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chief Integration Officer&rsquo;.Porqueras&rsquo; appointment as the chief transformation officer in April carried significance as the airline placed an order with European plane maker Airbus for 30 A350-900 wide-body aircraft the same month.&nbsp;This could position the airline as a hybrid airline or a full-service carrier similar to Air India.In June 2023, IndiGo placed the world&rsquo;s largest aircraft order, securing 500 A320neo family planes from Airbus. These aircraft are expected to be delivered between 2030 and 2035.&nbsp;The airline is on track to receive about 460 planes by 2030 from its previous deal with airbus.

    "body": "Malaysia&rsquo;s IHH Healthcare, which operates hospital networks under Fortis and Gleneagles brands, has no plans to list its diagnostics arm Agilus Diagnostics, a Fortis subsidiary, senior company officials said.The company believes that diagnostics services (or laboratory business), which currently contributes around 7 to 10 per cent of IHH&rsquo;s global turnover, is &lsquo;integral&rsquo; to its operations in any country.&ldquo;We have got the top lab in the country in three countries &ndash; Singapore, Malaysia and Turkey &ndash; to support our operations. We feel in India we need a reliable laboratory to support Fortis and Gleneagles growth,&rdquo; said Prem Kumar Nair, Group CEO, IHH healthcare.&ldquo;We are not thinking of an IPO or anything at the moment,&rdquo; he added.Recently, Fortis Healthcare acquired a 31 per cent stake held by private equity players in Agilus Diagnostics for Rs 1780 crore, a deal that valued Agilus at Rs 5,700 crore.Agilus is planning to expand its footprint (currently 400 labs and 4,000-odd collection touch points), and is open to inorganic expansion as well in India.Ashok Pandit, group chief corporate officer, IHH healthcare, said it has enough cash on its books, and is well capitalised. As of August 31, it has Rs 270 crore cash in its books.IHH plans to grow its laboratory business vertical (IHH Laboratories) globally. It intends to focus more on higher end tests like oncology work, genomics tests, molecular genetics, and precision medicines.The Malaysian major is planning to double its bed capacity in India to 10,000 in the next few years, Nair said, adding that of this around 2,000 beds would come through brownfield expansion in the next 4-5 years.At present, IHH operates over 5,000 beds in India under Fortis and Gleneagles.Fortis plans to add close to 2,000 beds and Gleneagles another 600 beds. Globally, IHH has announced plans to add 4,000 beds organically over the next few years, of which more than 50 per cent is likely to take place in India.Another 3,000-odd beds would eventually come through possible acquisitions, where the company is looking at assets which are in its core markets.This is strategically aligned with its current operations; and from a returns perspective is EPS positive in two to three years.Nair clarified that Fortis can fund its growth plans from internal accruals.India is among the top markets globally for IHH, and according to its second quarter results presentation, it contributes 17 per cent to its global revenues and 13.7 percent to Ebitda as of H12024 calendar.IHH bought a 31.7 per cent stake in then struggling Fortis Healthcare in 2018 and had plans to make an open offer at Rs 170 per share to acquire another 26.1 per cent.This, however, has been delayed due to litigation. Shares of Fortis Healthcare have more than tripled in the last six years, currently trading at levels above Rs 600.Pandit said: &ldquo;Let&#39;s wait and see where we end up. But we are very happy with where the Fortis stock price is.&rdquo;He added that they are engaging with the regulator on the open offer.Recently, it has acquired full ownership of Global Hospitals&rsquo; remaining stake held by Ravindranath GE Medical Associates for around Rs 740 crore.It acquired a 73.4 per cent stake in Global Hospital for Rs 1,284 crore in 2015.For now, IHH would continue with a dual-brand strategy in India..storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",

    "body": "By Julia Fioretti, Baiju Kalesh and Dave Sebastian&nbsp;LG Electronics Inc.&rsquo;s India unit may get a lower valuation than previously expected in its initial public offering, according to people familiar with the development, after the recent decline in the nation&rsquo;s stock market.&nbsp;&nbsp;The valuation could dip to a dollar amount of between roughly $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion, the people said, versus earlier expectations for as much as $15 billion. The IPO could take place as soon as May, they said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the valuation figure is potentially lower, LG Electronics India might raise as much as $1.7 billion in the IPO, which is more than originally anticipated, the people said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberations are ongoing and details including the numbers may change, they said.&nbsp;A representative at LG Electronics in Korea declined to comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;India&rsquo;s benchmark Sensex index has dropped about 10% from a record high in September, a month after LG Chief Executive Officer William Cho told Bloomberg Television that an IPO in Mumbai was being considered.&nbsp;&nbsp;LG filed its IPO application in December, and received approval for the listing from the Securities and Exchange Board of India earlier this month.&nbsp;&nbsp;A share sale of that size would be one of India&rsquo;s biggest, but still a way off Hyundai Motor India Ltd.&rsquo;s $3.3 billion IPO last year. Hyundai India&rsquo;s shares have fallen about 11% since their debut.&nbsp;",

Further, pre-filing DRHP does not guarantee the company will go ahead with the initial public offering (IPO).The preliminary IPO papers were received by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on February 13, however, &quot;draft offer document (was) withdrawn on March 19, 2025&quot; by the company without disclosing any reasons.Last week, PhysicsWallah joined the league of a handful of companies that took confidential filing routes for its IPO.In 2024, food delivery giant Swiggy and supermart major Vishal Mega Mart successfully floated their respective initial share sales after making confidential filings.Before this, online hotel aggregator OYO took the confidential filing route in 2023 but did not proceed with the initial share sale. Tata Play, formerly known as Tata Sky, was the first company in India to use the confidential pre-filing of draft papers for an IPO in December 2022 and obtained the regulator&#39;s observation letter in April 2023. However, the company did not proceed with the public issue.Under the pre-filing route, there is no pressure on the company to go for an IPO, experts said.Moreover, unlike the traditional route where companies have to launch the IPO within 12 months from the Sebi approval, or final observation; in the pre-filing route, an IPO can be floated within 18 months from the date of Sebi&#39;s final comments. This route also provides flexibility to change the primary issue size by 50 per cent till the Updated Draft Red Herring Prospectus (UDRHP) stage, they added.On the other hand, Sebi returned the draft IPO papers of Agriwarehousing and Collateral Management Ltd, a tech-driven agricultural services firm, on March 19.The company&#39;s proposed IPO comprises a fresh issue of equity shares aggregating up to Rs 450 crore and an Offer-For-Sale (OFS) component of 2.69 crore equity shares by promoters and an investor, according to the draft papers filed in December.As part of the OFS, Claymore Investments (Mauritius) Pte, an indirect subsidiary of Temasek Holdings, proposed to offer 19 crore equity shares through the OFS and the remaining 1.5 crore shares to be offloaded by promoters.",

    "body": "By Sankalp Phartiyal and Baiju Kalesh&nbsp;Online grocer Zepto is in talks for current stockholders to sell as much as $250 million of their equity, a move aimed at boosting the ownership of Indian investors before the startup seeks to go public later this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The private equity arms of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. and Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd. are in discussions with the Bangalore-based startup to buy shares in the secondary sale, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity to speak about confidential matters.&nbsp;Zepto won&rsquo;t raise any additional capital in the process, but employees and some existing investors will be able to sell their shares for cash. The company expects to execute the transactions at a valuation of just over $5 billion, the same level as its most recent funding round late last year, the people said.&nbsp;&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Zepto expands to deliver Apple products within 10 minutes in select cities&nbsp;The move is part of Zepto&rsquo;s plan to increase shareholding by Indian investors ahead of an initial public offering of shares later this year or early 2026, the people said. Indian shareholders currently account for about 33 per cent of Zepto&rsquo;s cap table, with founders Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra owning about a fifth of the firm. The goal is to lift that overall proportion to about 50 per cent, one of the people said.&nbsp;Zepto and Motilal Oswal did not respond to requests for comment, while Edelweiss declined to comment.&nbsp;Historically, secondary stock sales have been controversial because they allow managers and other employees to cash in before an IPO or sale, potentially making them less motivated in building the business. More recently however, such sales have become a way to reward staff &mdash; with the goal of boosting morale &mdash; and allowing investors to take money off the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zepto competes in India&rsquo;s hyper-competitive, low-margin grocery delivery space. Rivals in the market include e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc.&rsquo;s India unit and homegrown competitors such as SoftBank Group Corp.-backed Swiggy Ltd., publicly traded Zomato Ltd., and conglomerate Tata Group&rsquo;s BigBasket.&nbsp;Palicha and Vohra, 22, childhood friends, dropped out of Stanford University&rsquo;s computer science program and returned to India to build the startup in 2021, when they were teenagers.",

    "title": "Decoded: How to grow Rs 20 lakh into Rs 1 crore kitty in just 10 years",
    "body": "&nbsp;If you have&nbsp; Rs 20 lakh to invest and are wondering how to grow it into Rs 1 crore, you&#39;re in the right place. A 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over 8-10 years is an achievable goal for a moderate-risk investor seeking a balance between stable growth and long-term wealth creation.&nbsp; Here&#39;s a structured approach by&nbsp;Inderbir Singh&nbsp; Jolly, CEO - Wealth, PL Capital to help you meet that target.&nbsp;Investment Plan for 15% CAGR GrowthTo grow Rs 20 lakh into Rs 1 crore within around 10 years, a disciplined and diversified investment approach is key. The following asset allocation plan will help you target a 15% CAGR, ensuring both stability and growth:&nbsp;&nbsp;Equity Mutual Funds (Large, Mid, Small Cap) &ndash; 50% (Rs 10 L)&nbsp;Expected Returns: 15% CAGREquity mutual funds are the backbone of your investment strategy, offering substantial growth potential. Diversifying across large, mid, and small-cap funds provides a good mix of stability and growth, making this a core part of your plan.&nbsp;Index Funds & ETFs (Nifty 50, Sensex, Nasdaq) &ndash; 20% (Rs 4 L)&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected Returns: 12% CAGRIndex funds and ETFs allow you to invest in a broad market basket like the Nifty 50 or Sensex. These funds tend to have lower costs and offer steady returns, providing stability to your portfolio.&nbsp;Debt Funds & Fixed Income (Bonds, FDs, PPF) &ndash; 15% (₹3 L)&nbsp;Expected Returns: 6%-8% CAGRAdding debt instruments, such as bonds, fixed deposits (FDs), and Public Provident Fund (PPF), will give you a stable and safe income stream. These are low-risk, low-return investments, but they are important for reducing overall portfolio volatility.&nbsp;REITs & Gold (Real Estate Investment Trusts, Sovereign Gold Bonds) &ndash; 10% (₹2 L)&nbsp;Expected Returns: 10%-12% CAGR&nbsp;Real estate and gold act as effective hedges against inflation and market downturns. REITs offer real estate exposure without owning physical property, while sovereign gold bonds provide returns tied to gold prices. Both add a layer of diversification.&nbsp;Cash & Emergency Fund &ndash; 5% (Rs 1 L) Expected Returns: 4%-6% CAGRAlways keep an emergency fund. This provides liquidity in case of urgent needs, ensuring you don&rsquo;t have to dip into your investments during market dips.&nbsp;Growth Projection at 15% CAGRThe key to wealth creation is consistent growth over time. Below is a projection of your Rs 20 lakh investment over the next 8 years with a 15% CAGR:&nbsp;&nbsp;By year 9-10, your investment will likely surpass ₹1 crore, giving you a substantial return on your original ₹20 lakh.&nbsp;Combination Lump Sum & SIP for Better ReturnsTo reduce risk and better capitalize on market fluctuations, consider a combination of lump sum and Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). Instead of investing the entire ₹20 lakh upfront, you could:&nbsp;Invest Rs 10 lakh initially as a lump sum.Invest Rs 25,000 monthly via SIP for the remaining ₹10 lakh.This strategy ensures that you don&rsquo;t invest all your money at a market peak and can take advantage of market dips.&nbsp;Alternative Boost (Optional)For investors willing to take on a slightly higher risk, allocating 5%-10% of your portfolio to emerging sectors such as Electric Vehicles (EVs), Artificial Intelligence (AI), or international markets could push your returns to 16-17% CAGR. These sectors have great potential for rapid growth, but they come with increased risk.&nbsp;Key Takeaways:&nbsp;A 15% CAGR is achievable with disciplined investing.Diversification across asset classes reduces risk.A combination of lump sum and SIP investments maximizes returns while minimizing market entry risks.A structured plan can take you from ₹20 lakh to ₹1 crore in around 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "title": "What is Sea Dragon 2025, the anti-submarine warfare training India joined?",
    "body": "The Indian Navy on Thursday concluded a two week training session on anti-submarine warfare (ASW). This comes as India has been working to boost its maritime security and defense capabilities. The multinational ASW, called Sea Dragon 2025 (SD25), hosted by the United States Navy&rsquo;s 7th Fleet, is not just an exercise for the navy but also helps foster military cooperation with key allies.&nbsp;What is Sea Dragon 2025?The Sea Dragon exercise is a multinational anti-submarine warfare drill conducted annually to strengthen maritime security and cooperation among allied nations in the Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hosted by the United States Navy&rsquo;s 7th Fleet at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, this exercise focuses on detecting, tracking, and countering submarine threats, a crucial capability given the rising tensions in the region.&nbsp;What happens during the AWS exercise?Sea Dragon is an intensive, highly technical military drill that involves both theoretical and practical ASW training. Participating nations deploy their maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft (MPRA), which are equipped with advanced sensors and sonobuoys designed to track submarines. The training includes mock drills, tactical discussions, and live submarine detection exercises, allowing crews to sharpen their ability to locate and neutralise enemy submarines in real-world scenarios.&nbsp; This year the exercise focused on improving ASW tactics, interoperability, and multinational coordination in the Indo-Pacific region. The exercise included:Mobile ASW training target drills using the MK-30 &lsquo;SLED&rsquo;.A live ASWEX exercise, where participants tracked a US Navy submarine.A competitive phase, where aircrews were graded on ASW effectiveness.&nbsp;Which countries participate in the AWS?Originally a bilateral naval drill between US and Australia in 2019, the Sea Dragon exercise has expanded to include key allies, including India &ndash; which joined in 2021. This latest exercise also adds to India&rsquo;s effort at strengthening its maritime presence.&nbsp;India officially joined the exercise in 2021, aligning it with the country&rsquo;s broader strategy of enhancing its naval capabilities and deepening security ties with Quad nations and other regional allies.&nbsp;This year, the exercise was held from March 4 to March 19, and included Australia, Japan, South Korea, and the United States, with India participating for the fourth consecutive year.&nbsp;Hosted by Commander, Task Force (CTF) 72, the exercise brought together advanced ASW aircraft from participating nations, including:Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-8A PoseidonIndian Navy (IN) P-8I NeptuneJapan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) Kawasaki P-1Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) P-3 OrionUS Navy P-8A Poseidon (Patrol Squadrons VP-16 & VP-47)&nbsp;At the end of the training, the SD25 also featured a competition to evaluate each nation&rsquo;s ASW capabilities in a realistic combat scenario. This year, the RAAF emerged victorious.&nbsp;Embed tweet: https://x.com/USPacificFleet/status/1902467140784931059&nbsp;Why Sea Dragon matters for India and the Indo-PacificThe significance of the Sea Dragon exercise extends beyond mere training. It plays a key role in strengthening naval ties between India and its allies, ensuring greater interoperability in case of real-world threats.&nbsp;Additionally, exercises like Sea Dragon help in reinforcing the concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific, a shared vision among the Quad nations (India, the US, Japan, and Australia). By actively participating, India enhances its deterrence capabilities and ensures that it remains a key player in shaping the security architecture of the region.&nbsp;India strengthens maritime securityIndia has been making significant strides in strengthening its maritime security amid rising concerns over foreign military activities in the Indian Ocean, particularly China&rsquo;s growing influence.&nbsp;In December 2024, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) sanctioned a massive ₹21,772 crore package to address emerging maritime threats, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. This included 151 new boats for the Indian Navy, aimed at coastal patrols, rapid response, and surveillance, as well as six advanced light helicopters (ALH) for the Indian Coast Guard to enhance search-and-rescue missions and reconnaissance.&nbsp;",

    "title": "Who was Aurangzeb, 17th-century Mughal ruler who remains controversial?",
    "body": "On Monday, Nagpur city in Maharashtra witnessed violent clashes and arson following demands by pro-Hindu groups for the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb&rsquo;s tomb. Over 30 police personnel were injured, with shops and vehicles gutted, leading to a curfew in several areas. Similar clashes occurred in June 2023 in Maharashtra&rsquo;s Kolhapur after social media posts allegedly glorified the Mughal ruler.&nbsp;Aurangzeb, the 17th-century Mughal emperor, remains a polarising figure. His over 50-year reign saw significant economic growth for India, but he is often remembered as a ruthless tyrant who allegedly hated music and ordered the destruction of several Hindu temples. While popular narratives describe his policies as intolerant towards non-Islamic faiths, some historians argue they were more politically motivated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s &lsquo;reign of terror&rsquo;&nbsp;Born Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad on November 3, 1618, in Dahod, Gujarat, Aurangzeb was the third son of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. He ascended to the Mughal throne in 1658 after a power struggle, which included defeating his brother Dara Shikoh and imprisoning his father until the latter&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;Unlike his great-grandfather Akbar, known for his secular policies, Aurangzeb was less tolerant towards non-Muslims. He re-imposed the jizya tax on non-Muslims, which had been abolished by Akbar. Aurangzeb also ordered the destruction of some Hindu temples. The most noted act of his tyranny was the execution of the ninth Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur, for refusing to convert to Islam. The Zafarnama, a letter written in 1705 by the tenth Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh, indicts Aurangzeb for moral and spiritual bankruptcy, highlighting Guru Tegh Bahadur&rsquo;s sacrifice to save Hindus from forced conversion.&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s achievements&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s nearly 50-year reign from 1658 to 1707 marked the Mughal empire&rsquo;s greatest territorial extent, with significant military campaigns in South India. He successfully conquered the Deccan states, including Bijapur in 1686 and Golconda in 1687, extending the empire to cover about 4 million square kilometers by 1689, with a population over 158 million. His campaigns also reached southern regions like Tanjore and Trichinopoly, though maintaining control was challenging.&nbsp;Historian Angus Maddison estimates that in 1700, India accounted for approximately 25 per cent of the global GDP, surpassing the combined GDP of Europe at that time. This period also marked a phase of proto-industrialization, with India producing about 25 per cent of the world&rsquo;s industrial output up until the 18th century, excelling in sectors such as textiles, shipbuilding, and steel.&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s personal life included copying the Quran and sewing caps for a living, reflecting his piety, which contrasts with the ruthless ruler image often portrayed.&nbsp;Divide among historians&nbsp;While the destruction of temples under Aurangzeb&rsquo;s rule is highlighted, some historians note that he made exceptions in granting land and support to places of worship of Hindus and other faiths. In &lsquo;Aurangzeb: The Man and the Myth,&rsquo; historian Audrey Truschke notes the grant given by Aurangzeb to Jangam, a Shaivite group. Truschke also claims that there was a higher proportion of Hindus in Aurangzeb&rsquo;s administration compared to Akbar, arguing that his actions were often politically driven, not solely religious.&nbsp; In &#39;Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (Volumet 2),&#39; historian Satish Chandra notes that the Mughal ruler commissioned grants to some of the &quot;Vaishnava temples at Vrindavan, to the jogis at Jakhbar in Punjab, to the Nath Panthi jogis in Sarkar Nagaur, and grant of 100 pakka bighas of land to Panth Bharati in pargana Siwana in Rajasthan.&quot; He also gave grants to the gurdwara of Guru Ram Das in Dehradun, Chandra states.&nbsp;However, historian John F Richards opines that Aurangzeb&rsquo;s ultimate aim was the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam. In his book &lsquo;The Mughal Empire,&rsquo; part of The New Cambridge History of India series, Richards states, &ldquo;Whenever possible the emperor gave out robes of honour, cash gifts, and promotions to converts. It quickly became known that conversion was a sure way to the emperor&rsquo;s favour.&rdquo;&nbsp;Contested legacy&nbsp;Aurangzeb&rsquo;s legacy remains deeply contested, with interpretations of his rule varying between tyranny and pragmatism. While his policies contributed to the Mughal Empire&rsquo;s territorial expansion and economic strength, his religious intolerance and political ruthlessness left lasting scars. As debates over his reign continue to fuel contemporary tensions, his place in history remains as divisive as ever.",

    "title": "Decoded: What is an autopen and did Biden use it to sign pardon documents?",
    "body": "US President Donald Trump has declared that all pardons signed by US President Joe Biden are invalid, claiming they were executed using an autopen &ndash; a mechanical device that reproduces a person&rsquo;s signature.&nbsp;&ldquo;The &lsquo;Pardons&rsquo; that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!&rdquo; Trump wrote.&nbsp;He alleged that Biden had no knowledge or approval of the documents, suggesting potential criminal conduct by those involved.&nbsp;Trump also accused members of the &ldquo;Unselect Committee&rdquo; of manipulating the process and claimed the documents were signed without the knowledge or consent of &ldquo;the Worst President in the History of our Country, Crooked Joe Biden.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is an autopen and why does it matter?&nbsp;An autopen is a device used to sign documents without direct human involvement. It has been in use by US presidents and lawmakers for decades. Barack Obama was the first president to use an autopen to sign an executive order, according to Newsweek.&nbsp;Interestingly, Trump himself has used an autopen extensively. A Daily Mail analysis found at least 25 identical Trump signatures on federal documents during his presidency, indicating autopen use.&nbsp;While George W Bush avoided using it due to legal concerns, Obama used it openly, notably for the 2013 fiscal bill. Legal experts have debated the validity of autopen signatures, especially on critical documents, but there is no definitive ruling against their use for executive actions.&nbsp;Allegations against Biden&rsquo;s autopen use&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s claims follow a report by the Oversight Project, a division of the conservative think tank behind Project 2025. The group alleged that Biden used an autopen to sign &ldquo;nearly every document we could find&rdquo; during his presidency.&nbsp;&ldquo;We gathered every document we could find with Biden&rsquo;s signature over the course of his presidency. All used the same autopen signature except for the announcement that the former President was dropping out of the race last year,&rdquo; the Oversight Project posted on X.&nbsp;????WHOEVER CONTROLLED THE AUTOPEN CONTROLLED THE PRESIDENCY????&nbsp; We gathered every document we could find with Biden&#39;s signature over the course of his presidency.&nbsp; All used the same autopen signature except for the the announcement that the former President was dropping out of the&hellip; https://t.co/CC3oJUkNr4 pic.twitter.com/mtNrZsALDu&mdash; Oversight Project (@OversightPR) March 6, 2025&nbsp;They presented three examples of Biden&rsquo;s autopen signatures on executive orders from August 2022 and December 2024, and a July 2024 letter where Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race. The two executive orders appeared to have identical autopen signatures, while the letter bore a different signature, possibly handwritten.&nbsp;Fox News reported reviewing over 20 executive orders signed between 2021 and 2024, all allegedly bearing identical autopen signatures.&nbsp;However, CNN reported in 2024 that autopen use in Biden&rsquo;s administration was rare. Biden went to great lengths to sign key documents in person, such as a $40 billion Ukraine aid package signed in South Korea and a bill to prevent a government shutdown signed while on holiday in St Croix.&nbsp;The Oversight Project has suggested Biden may not have personally approved these documents, raising questions about who controlled the autopen and what oversight was in place.&nbsp;Political and legal reactions&nbsp;The allegations have sparked strong political reactions. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Trump ally, sent a letter to the Department of Justice calling for an investigation into whether Biden&rsquo;s cognitive state allowed unelected staff to implement policies without his direct approval.&nbsp;Bailey argued that if Biden was not fully aware of the orders being signed, they would be &ldquo;null and void,&rdquo; and states had a right to know.&nbsp;He claimed that Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson was blocked by White House officials from meeting with Biden. Johnson later said in an interview that Biden appeared unaware of signing an executive order on energy exports, claiming he only authorised a study on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).&nbsp;The Oversight Project shared a video of Johnson&rsquo;s interview, alleging Biden lacked control over key decisions. Heritage Foundation attorney Samuel Dewey noted Hunter Biden&rsquo;s pardon signature seemed &ldquo;shaky&rdquo;, implying it was signed manually, unlike other autopen signatures.&nbsp;[With agency inputs]",

    "title": "Decoded: What does the Oilfields Bill 2024 mean for India's energy sector?",
    "body": "The Lok Sabha passed the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Bill, 2024 on March 12, 2025, marking a significant step in modernising India&rsquo;s oil and gas sector. The Bill seeks to update the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948, bringing clarity to resource governance, attracting private investment, and addressing environmental concerns.&nbsp;Key changes introduced in the bill&nbsp;The scope of mineral oils have been broadened by the amendment to include hydrocarbons such as crude oil, natural gas, petroleum, condensate, coal bed methane, shale gas, and oil. However, it explicitly excludes coal, lignite, and helium, likely because these are governed under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.&nbsp;The Bill replaces the term &lsquo;mining leases&rsquo; with &lsquo;petroleum leases&rsquo;, which will now govern exploration, production, and disposal activities. This change aims to streamline environmental and land clearances, which have often caused delays in oil and gas projects. The Bill clarifies that existing mining leases issued under the 1948 Act will remain valid and unchanged.&nbsp;&nbsp;The violations of the Oilfields Act, 1948, could previously result in imprisonment of up to six months or a fine of ₹1,000, or both. The new Bill replaces imprisonment with financial penalties, increasing the maximum fine to ₹25 lakh. If violations continue, an extra fine of up to ₹10 lakh per day may be imposed. The move shifts the focus from criminal prosecution to financial deterrents for non-compliance.&nbsp;What are the objectives of the bill?&nbsp;The government aims to use this Bill to strengthen domestic oil and gas production, reducing dependence on imports. Currently, India imports over 85 per cent of its crude oil and about 50 per cent of its natural gas, making energy security a critical issue. Further, the Bill seeks to attract private investment into petroleum production while ensuring that the rights of existing leaseholders are not compromised.&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater central government control&nbsp;The Bill grants the Central government greater rule-making powers to regulate various aspects of petroleum leases, which included the merging of petroleum leases for operational efficiency, the sharing of infrastructure facilities among leaseholders, and the obligations of lessees to protect the environment and reduce emissions. It also introduces alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, allowing conflicts to be settled either within India or internationally.&nbsp;A new system for handling penalties has been introduced, with an officer of Joint Secretary rank or higher being appointed to adjudicate financial violations. Appeals against their decisions will be directed to the Appellate Tribunal under the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) Act, 2006. If further appeals are needed, cases will be heard by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, which operates under the Electricity Act, 2003.&nbsp;Potential concerns of the oil regulation bill&nbsp;One of the major concerns is whether the shift from mining leases to petroleum leases could affect states&rsquo; taxation powers under Entry 50 of the State List in the Indian Constitution.&nbsp;The Supreme Court ruling in Mineral Area Development Authority vs Steel Authority of India (2024) reaffirmed that states have exclusive power to tax mining activities. Critics argue that the Bill could lead to disputes over revenue-sharing and jurisdiction between states and the Centre since &lsquo;Entry 53 of the Union List&rsquo; gives the central government control over oilfields.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Bill promoting greater private sector involvement, some critics argue that it may weaken environmental safeguards. The new financial penalties replace imprisonment, which could reduce accountability for environmental violations and safety lapses in oilfields.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Opposition parties have raised concerns that government-owned enterprises like ONGC should be prioritised over private companies for oil exploration and production. There are fears that increased private participation could prioritise profit-making over community welfare and long-term sustainability.&nbsp;What are the Centre&rsquo;s plans?&nbsp;Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri defended the Bill, stating that it is a &lsquo;constructive and positive step&rsquo; toward boosting India&rsquo;s oil and gas production. He highlighted the government&rsquo;s commitment to opening up new exploration areas, including those previously classified as &lsquo;no-go zones&rsquo;.&nbsp;Additionally, the Bill aligns with the government&rsquo;s energy security strategy, particularly after the launch of the 10th Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) bidding round on February 11, 2025. The primary focus of the policy is primarily offshore exploration blocks.&nbsp;Puri also noted that India&rsquo;s crude oil demand is expected to rise to 6.5-7 million barrels per day (bpd) from the current 5.5 million bpd, emphasising the urgency of strengthening domestic production.",

    "title": "Nasdaq tumbles: A look back at the biggest stock market crashes",
    "body": "US stock markets witnessed a sharp decline on Monday, with major indices tumbling after former President Donald Trump&rsquo;s recent comments fuelled fears of an economic downturn. Investors reacted negatively, leading to one of the worst trading days in months.&nbsp;The S&P 500 dropped 155.64 points, a 2.7 per cent decline, closing at 5,614.56&mdash;its lowest level since September and its steepest single-day percentage drop since December. The Nasdaq Composite, heavily weighted towards technology stocks, plunged 727.90 points (4 per cent) to close at 17,468.32, its lowest since September.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 890.01 points (2.08 per cent) to 41,911.71, marking its weakest close since early November.&nbsp;Over the weekend, Trump was asked in an interview with Fox News Channel whether he foresaw a recession in 2025. His response, while not a direct confirmation, hinted at economic turbulence ahead.&nbsp;&ldquo;I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we&rsquo;re doing is very big. We&rsquo;re bringing wealth back to America. That&rsquo;s a big thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It takes a little time. It takes a little time.&rdquo;&nbsp;Investors fear that escalating trade tensions could push the US economy into a recession. While market corrections are not uncommon, steep declines like this have historically had multiple causes. Here&rsquo;s a look at past financial crises that shook markets worldwide.&nbsp;Major market crashes in the US&nbsp;The Great Depression (1929)Triggered by the Wall Street crash of 1929, the Great Depression severely impacted the global economy. The DJIA plunged nearly 25 per cent over two days (October 28-29). By mid-1932, the market had declined 89 per cent from its peak. The crash was fuelled by rampant speculation, excessive borrowing, and economic instability, leading to mass unemployment, food shortages, and widespread poverty.&nbsp;Black Monday (October 19, 1987)One of the most dramatic market crashes in history, Black Monday saw the DJIA plunge 22.6 per cent in a single day&mdash;the largest one-day percentage drop ever. Months of rapid stock gains had led to fears of an asset bubble, while a growing trade deficit and a weakening dollar further rattled investor confidence.&nbsp;Dot-com bubble burst (March 2000 - October 2002)The dot-com bubble burst after a period of rapid growth in IT and telecommunications. The rise of the internet led to an explosion of online businesses, attracting heavy investment. However, after peaking in March 2000, the Nasdaq crashed by about 78 per cent by October 2002 due to excessive speculation and failing tech startups.&nbsp;Post-9/11 market reaction (September 2001)Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, US stock markets remained closed for nearly a week. The destruction of the World Trade Center, a key financial hub, caused nearly 3,000 deaths and sent shockwaves through the economy.&nbsp;The airline and insurance industries were hit the hardest. With flights grounded for days, airline stocks saw steep losses. American Airlines and United Airlines, which operated the hijacked flights, suffered massive declines. The insurance industry also faced billions in claims, leading to a liquidity crisis for several firms.&nbsp;Global financial crisis (October 2008)The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 triggered a worldwide financial crisis. The Nasdaq, along with other major indices, experienced multiple days of declines exceeding 10 per cent. The crisis was driven by the collapse of major financial institutions, largely due to risky subprime mortgages and frozen credit markets. Banks, including those in the US and Northern Rock in the UK, had adopted a model where they originated and sold mortgages, packaging them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). In 2007, Northern Rock faced a run on deposits, which ended only when the UK government guaranteed them. In September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, plunging the global financial system into crisis. Government bailouts and stimulus measures were required to stabilise the financial system.&nbsp;Covid-19 market crash (March 2020)The Covid-19 pandemic caused extreme market volatility, with repeated 10 per cent+ drops in March 2020. Lockdowns, economic uncertainty, and investor panic led to trading halts.&nbsp;Major global market crashes&nbsp;2015 Chinese stock market crashBetween June 2014 and June 2015, China&rsquo;s Shanghai Composite Index surged 150 per cent, fuelled by speculative trading. By mid-2015, the bubble burst, causing a 32 per cent drop in a month and an overall 40 per cent decline.&nbsp;2022 Russian stock market crashFollowing Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) index fell 43.58 per cent in just four trading days in February 2022. Western sanctions and economic uncertainty fuelled panic selling, prompting Russia&rsquo;s central bank to halt trading temporarily.&nbsp;Major stock market crashes in India&nbsp;1865 cotton boom and bustOne of India&rsquo;s earliest market crashes was in May 1865, a decade before the Bombay Stock Exchange was incorporated. It was caused by excessive speculation in cotton exports during the American Civil War. When the war ended, cotton prices collapsed, triggering a severe market crash. Mumbai&rsquo;s economy suffered, and its population declined by 21 per cent over the next few years.&nbsp;1982 Reliance short-selling crisisA bear cartel attempted to crash Reliance Industries&rsquo; stock by offloading shares, driving prices down. In a few days, Reliance&rsquo;s share price dropped sharply. However, a counter-group known as the &ldquo;Friends of Reliance&rdquo; bought up shares, reversing the trend and stabilising the market.&nbsp;1992 Harshad Mehta scamStockbroker Harshad Mehta manipulated stock prices using fraudulent bank funds, inflating the BSE Sensex from 1,000 to over 4,500 points. When the scam was exposed, the market crashed by nearly 2,000 points, wiping out ₹1 trillion in investor wealth.&nbsp;2008 global financial crisis impact on IndiaThe 2008 crisis led to foreign investors pulling out of Indian markets. The Sensex lost over 50 per cent of its value that year, with banks and financial stocks taking the worst hit.&nbsp;November 2016 demonetisationThe Indian government declared ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes would no longer be legal tender, causing a market shock. The BSE Sensex crashed nearly 1,689 points, while the NIFTY 50 fell 541 points.&nbsp;March 2020 Covid-19 pandemic crashThe Covid-19 outbreak led to panic selling across global markets, including India. The Sensex and NIFTY saw record single-day drops as lockdowns and economic fears spooked investors.&nbsp;",

    "title": "Decoded: Trump calls Japan security deal unfair, but US made the rules",
    "body": "US President Donald Trump has once again turned his attention to America&rsquo;s security alliances, this time singling out Japan. In a recent media address from his Oval Office, Trump questioned the terms of the US-Japan defence pact, saying, &ldquo;We have an interesting deal with Japan, that we have to protect them, but they don&rsquo;t have to protect us&hellip; Who makes these deals?&rdquo;&nbsp;At first glance, Trump&rsquo;s frustration may appear justified&mdash;why should the United States pledge to defend a country that is under no obligation to do the same? However, asking this question without considering history ignores the very foundations of the US-Japan security alliance.&nbsp;Especially when it is the United States itself that shaped this agreement, a legacy dating back to the end of World War II, when the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over 200,000 people (conservative estimates) and subsequently dismantling Japan&rsquo;s military apparatus. What Trump characterises as an unfair deal is, in fact, an American creation&mdash;one that has served both nations for decades.&nbsp;Read: Who are Syria&#39;s Alawites? The sect facing violence after Assad&#39;s fall&nbsp;A US-designed peace for Japan after World War II&nbsp;The roots of Japan&rsquo;s security arrangement with the United States can be traced back to August 1945, when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombings. The US led a seven-year occupation under General Douglas MacArthur, with the twin goals of demilitarising and democratising the country. During this period, Japan&rsquo;s wartime military was completely dismantled. The country&rsquo;s constitution was drafted under the supervision of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), primarily led by MacArthur.&nbsp;By 1947, the US had imposed a new constitution on Japan, which remains in force today. Its most defining feature was Article 9, which explicitly renounced war and prohibited Japan from maintaining a military capable of offensive action. The clause, written under American oversight, was meant to ensure that Japan could never again become a military aggressor.&nbsp;This decision was not imposed on Japan alone&mdash;it aligned with broader US objectives. In the wake of World War II, America sought to establish a global order where it held military supremacy, allowing its allies to focus on economic recovery rather than defence. Japan&rsquo;s disarmament was not just a policy imposed on a defeated enemy&mdash;it was part of a larger American vision.&nbsp;From demilitarising Japan to turning it into a strategic ally&nbsp;In the years immediately following Japan&rsquo;s surrender, the United States focused on dismantling Japan&rsquo;s military and war industries. However, the onset of the Cold War led to a shift in priorities. The US soon realised that a stable Japan was crucial in countering the spread of communism, particularly after China fell to communist rule in 1949 and the Korean War erupted in 1950.&nbsp;During the Korean War, Japan became a key logistics hub for US-led United Nations forces. This reinforced Japan&rsquo;s strategic importance, leading Washington to reconsider Japan&rsquo;s total demilitarisation. By 1954, with US encouragement, Japan established the Self-Defence Forces (SDF)&mdash;a military in all but name. However, due to Article 9, the SDF remains limited in its scope, constrained from engaging in offensive warfare.&nbsp;The US-Japan Security Treaty: A deliberate American choice&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s suggestion that Japan benefits without reciprocating is inaccurate, as the US-Japan security arrangement was designed to function this way by the US itself. The first US-Japan Security Treaty was signed in 1951, alongside the Treaty of San Francisco, which formally ended the US occupation of Japan. The agreement allowed US military bases to remain in Japan, cementing the country as a cornerstone of America&rsquo;s strategic presence in South-east Asia.&nbsp;By 1960, a revised Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security committed the US to defend Japan in case of an attack. However, Japan did not reciprocate the same obligation&mdash;a design choice made by Washington, not Tokyo. The US preferred a permanent forward base in the Pacific rather than requiring Japan to maintain its own military.&nbsp;Today, approximately 54,000 US military personnel are stationed in Japan across multiple bases, making it the largest American overseas military presence. These bases provide a critical foothold in the Indo-Pacific, allowing the US to project power across Asia, monitor China&rsquo;s military expansion, and respond swiftly to regional conflicts. In return, Japan covers a significant portion of the costs&mdash;roughly $2 billion annually&mdash;for hosting these forces.&nbsp;How does Japan contribute to US security?&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s argument that Japan offers no protection in return is misleading. While Japan does not send troops to defend the US mainland, it plays a crucial role in maintaining regional security.&nbsp;&bull; Financial and logistical support: Japan&rsquo;s hosting of US military bases allows America to operate in the Indo-Pacific with speed and efficiency.&nbsp;&bull; Military cooperation: In 2015, Japan reinterpreted Article 9, allowing its Self-Defence Forces to engage in collective self-defence, meaning Japan can support US forces under attack.&nbsp;&bull; Technological and strategic contributions: Japan is a major partner in US missile defence systems and provides crucial intelligence-sharing through the Quad alliance with India and Australia.&nbsp;&bull; Regional stability: Japan&rsquo;s naval and air forces, while defensive, patrol the East China Sea and provide intelligence benefiting US military operations.&nbsp;Trump is ignoring history&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s suggestion that the US-Japan security alliance is a bad deal ignores the reality that it was the United States itself that structured it this way.&nbsp;The US chose to disarm Japan. The US chose to maintain military bases in Japan.&nbsp;And the US chose to design a security agreement that commits it to defending Japan without requiring Japan to do the same.&nbsp;If Trump wants to argue that America should renegotiate its military alliances, that is a legitimate policy debate. But to suggest that Japan is exploiting the US is an argument that collapses under the weight of history.&nbsp;To answer Trump&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;Who makes these deals?&rdquo;&mdash;the US did.",

The issue was raised in the Assembly on Saturday, with opposition legislators cornering the ruling National Conference (NC) over the matter.&nbsp;CPI(M) legislator MY Tarigami and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) legislator Waheed-ur-Rehmaan Parra criticised the government for reportedly granting evacuee property to the cricketer without any financial transaction. Tarigami, without naming Muralitharan, called for a clarification from the government.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am told a former Sri Lankan cricketer has been allotted land, which is an evacuee property, that too without [the cricketer] paying any penny. This is a serious matter. Land is not on sale for all. My concern is that the law of the land should be applicable equally to all. In this case, norms have been flouted,&rdquo; Tarigami said, as reported by The Hindu.&nbsp;Congress MLA Ghulam Ahmed Mir also sought an explanation from the government, questioning the decision to allot land to a non-Indian cricketer in Kathua without financial consideration. &ldquo;Why has a non-Indian cricketer been given land in Kathua without getting a penny from him?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;What did the government say?&nbsp;Responding to the Opposition&#39;s charges, Jammu and Kashmir Minister for Rural Development Javed Dar said the government had no information on the matter but would investigate. &ldquo;This is a matter related to the revenue department. We do not have any information, and we will look into it to know the facts,&rdquo; he said, as quoted by PTI.&nbsp;Notably, a report published in The Indian Express in July 2024 stated that during the Lieutenant Governor&rsquo;s administration, Muttiah Muralitharan&rsquo;s company, Ceylon Beverages, was allotted 25.75 acres (206 kanals) of land in Kathua for a Rs 1,600 crore soft drinks bottling and aluminium can-manufacturing plant.&nbsp;According to Director of Jammu&rsquo;s Industries and Commerce Department, Dr Arun Kumar Manhas, the lease deed was executed with department on June 14, 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;All about Ceylon Beverage&nbsp;Ceylon Beverage Can Pvt Ltd, established in 2020 and promoted by Muralitharan, is a Sri Lankan company specialising in the production of aluminum beverage cans. The company manufactures eight different sizes of slim, sleek, and standard cans, catering to a diverse range of customer labels. They collaborate with various firms to produce mineral water, energy drinks, soft drinks, and flavoured milk.&nbsp;In 2023, Ceylon Beverage announced its plan to enter the Indian market after it was allotted land in Dharwad, Karnataka by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board. In May 2023, Ceylon Beverage entered into a strategic partnership with Reliance Consumer Products to manufacture cans for the Campa soft drink.",

Alternatively, you might be looking for specialized exposures such as factor investing (e.g., low volatility, growth, momentum, or value stocks). Understanding your broader investment objectives is key before diving into specific index options.&nbsp;2. Consider InvestabilityInvestability refers to how easily the securities within an index can be traded. Indexes that track illiquid securities can lead to higher transaction costs and performance drag. For example, while AAA-rated bonds issued by central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and state development loans (SDLs) are relatively liquid, they are not as frequently traded as government bonds, which could create liquidity issues in certain market conditions.&nbsp;When evaluating an index, check whether there are investable products (ETFs or mutual funds) tracking the index. The presence of such products indicates that the index is practical for portfolio implementation and has sufficient liquidity.&nbsp;3. Diversification and RepresentativenessA key benefit of passive investing is diversification, which minimizes risks associated with individual securities. When selecting an index fund, ensure that the index you are investing in adequately represents the asset class or market segment. A highly concentrated index may introduce risks that undermine the benefits of diversification. While specialized or narrow indexes may seem appealing, they are typically better suited for tactical allocations rather than long-term, passive investing.&nbsp;4. Evaluate Index Construction MethodologyThe construction methodology of an index should be sound and based on an economic rationale. Indices like the Nasdaq-100 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, for instance, may have peculiar selection criteria that don&#39;t necessarily align with sound investment logic. An index that uses arbitrary rules or subjective decisions (such as the S&P 500, which relies on an investment committee) may not provide the transparency needed for long-term investing.&nbsp;Make sure the methodology of the index you are considering is transparent and based on objective criteria. This allows you to better predict the index&rsquo;s performance across market environments.&nbsp;5. Low TurnoverTurnover refers to the frequency with which the securities in an index are bought and sold. High turnover can lead to increased trading costs, especially in illiquid markets, which can diminish returns. A well-constructed index will seek to minimize unnecessary turnover. Look for funds that implement buffers for market-cap changes to limit turnover and reduce associated costs.&nbsp;6. Minimize Tracking ErrorEven the best-constructed index is only as good as its ability to track its underlying benchmark. Tracking error measures how closely an index fund&rsquo;s performance matches that of its index. A low tracking error indicates that the fund is replicating the index accurately and efficiently. Investors should prioritize funds with a stable and low tracking error to ensure their returns closely align with the performance of the underlying index.&nbsp;7. Role of Market MakersWhen it comes to ETFs, the role of market makers cannot be overlooked. Market makers ensure liquidity and fair pricing by continuously providing buy and sell quotes. ETFs with strong and multiple market makers tend to have narrower bid-ask spreads and more efficient pricing. In contrast, funds with fewer market makers may suffer from poor liquidity, especially during market volatility.&nbsp;In India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has mandated that each ETF should have at least two market makers to enhance liquidity and pricing efficiency. Before investing, ask your ETF provider who the market makers are and how many are involved in facilitating smooth trading.&nbsp;The difference between a well-constructed, efficient fund and one that fails to deliver often comes down to the details: Is the index well-structured, investable, and sufficiently diversified? These elements directly impact performance and risk, separating funds that merely exist from those that truly deliver. And don&#39;t overlook the unsung heroes&mdash;market makers&mdash;who keep ETFs liquid and prices fair.&nbsp;A good index fund is more than just low fees. Focus on your due diligence and dig deeper before deciding. And when it comes to highly specialized thematic or narrowly focused indexes, be extra cautious&mdash;they may look compelling, but they don&rsquo;t always deliver the diversification and stability that passive investors rely on.&nbsp; Here are the key takeaways:&nbsp;Choosing the Right Asset Class Matters:&nbsp;Investors should first determine the appropriate asset class or sub-asset class before selecting a benchmark. Passive investing is most effective in efficient markets with broad coverage and high liquidity.&nbsp;Assessing investability:&nbsp;Some indices include illiquid securities, making them difficult to track and costly to replicate Even in relatively high-quality fixed-income indexes like CRISIL IBX 70:30 CPSE Plus SDL April 2025 Index, nuances in market depth can present challenges.&nbsp;Index construction and its pitfalls&nbsp;Not all index methodologies are well-grounded in economic rationale.The Nasdaq-100 Index restricts inclusion to companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, an arbitrary constraint that excludes several major firms and not much representative of the US equity marketThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), despite its prominence, is flawed due to subjective stock selection and outdated price-weighted methodology rather than market capitalization weighting. This results in an index that does not accurately reflect market opportunities.&nbsp;Diversification & representativenessA well-structured index should mirror the underlying market composition.Highly concentrated indices introduce idiosyncratic risks, reducing the diversification advantage of passive investing.&nbsp;Market makers:&nbsp; The overlooked backbone of ETF liquidity&nbsp;&nbsp;Market makers are critical to ETF efficiency, ensuring fair pricing, tight bid-ask spreads, and smooth trade execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weak market-making support can lead to liquidity issues, price dislocations, and higher trading costs, negating the benefits of passive investing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors tend overlook this factor, but market depth and competition among market makers directly impact an ETF&rsquo;s tradability and cost-effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Key question to ask: Who is providing liquidity for this ETF, and how effectively are they maintaining pricing stability?&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracking error & fund efficiency&nbsp;The ultimate goal of an index fund is to closely replicate its benchmark.&nbsp;Investors should prioritize funds with low tracking errors to ensure minimal deviation from index returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "title": "Explained: Why Infosys, Cognizant are battling it out in a US court",
    "body": "IT giant Infosys and Cognizant, a Nasdaq-listed firm, are engaged in a bitter legal battle in a court in Dallas. The dispute centres on allegations of trade secret misappropriation and anti-competitive practices within the healthcare software sector.&nbsp;Here&#39;s everything you need to know about the case.&nbsp;What are Cognizant&#39;s allegations against Infosys?&nbsp;In August 2024, Cognizant&#39;s subsidiary and healthcare software, TriZetto, filed a case in a court in Dallas, Texas, against Infosys for allegedly stealing their trade secrets. TriZetto&#39;s software suite, including platforms like Facets and QNXT, is widely utilised by healthcare insurance companies to automate administrative tasks such as claims processing and payments. The lawsuit claims that Infosys unlawfully accessed and extracted data from TriZetto&#39;s databases to develop and market competing software solutions&nbsp;Cognizant alleges that Infosys misused TriZetto&#39;s software to create &#39;Test Cases for Facets,&#39; which purportedly repackaged TriZetto&#39;s data into an Infosys product. Additionally, the complaint accuses Infosys of developing software to extract data from QNXT, encompassing confidential information and trade secrets. Cognizant is seeking monetary damages and an injunction to prevent Infosys from further exploiting its proprietary information.&nbsp;On February 7 this year, Cognizant filed a 22-page response in a Dallas court, alleging that Infosys was &quot;caught red-handed&quot; misappropriating trade secrets related to TriZetto.&nbsp;Cognizant claimed that Infosys had access to these trade secrets through Non-Disclosure and Access Agreements (NDAAs) but misused this information to develop competing products. Furthermore, Cognizant alleged that Infosys obstructed efforts to audit its use of TriZetto&#39;s information, which could have clarified the specifics of the alleged misappropriation.&nbsp;What are Infosys&#39; allegations against Cognizant?&nbsp;In January 2025, Infosys knocked on the doors of the federal court, alleging anti-competitive practices and the poaching of key executives to hinder the development of its healthcare platform, Infosys Helix. The IT major accused Cognizant&#39;s current Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ravi Kumar, previously an Infosys veteran, of deliberately delaying the progress of its Helix Platform, which was designed to compete with Cognizant&#39;s TriZetto.&nbsp;Infosys claimed that Kumar, who joined Cognizant in January 2023, was also in charge of the development and sales of the platform, adding that he &quot;delayed the process&quot; since he was in talks with Cognizant. It further alleged that Kumar was &quot;aware of the confidential information and slowed Helix&#39;s launch by not allocating new talent to the project.&quot;&nbsp;&ldquo;His decisions effectively meant that, at the time, Infosys &#39;cannot do any new development&#39; for Helix,&quot; Infosys said, as reported by LiveMint.&nbsp;In its countersuit, Infosys accused Kumar of &quot;anticompetitive practices by maintaining its monopoly.&quot; Accusing him of misusing sensitive information, the IT firm sought a trial and three times the damages it claims to have suffered, Business Standard reported in January.&nbsp;What happened at February 28 hearing?&nbsp;Denying Cognizant&#39;s allegations in the court, Infosys said last week that &quot;Cognizant&rsquo;s mention of broad categories of trade secrets did not qualify as specific trade secrets that are alleged to have been stolen.&quot;&nbsp;The IT giant further urged the Dallas court to ask Cognizant to identify the alleged misappropriated trade secrets properly. The company denied Cognizant&rsquo;s allegations because the information about TriZetto was publicly available.&nbsp;&ldquo;The first six-plus pages of Cognizant&rsquo;s response are non-responsive background information about the Facets and QNXT software that reads like a marketing piece interspersed with legal argument,&quot;&nbsp; Infosys said in its 16-page reply to the court, as reported by LiveMint.&nbsp;Further, in its response, Infosys called out Cognizant&#39;s &quot;U-turn&quot; on how it wanted to file the &#39;legal documents.&#39; It stated that the lack of Cognizant&#39;s response is highlighted by its stance on how the documents may be filed publicly.&nbsp;Reiterating its stance, Infosys added not even a single test case related to the &#39;allegedly stolen trade secret&#39; was recognised by Cognizant.&nbsp;The case comes at a time when both Cognizant and Infosys are eyeing the second spot in the Indian IT services industry after Tata Consultancy Services.",

    "title": "Ranya Rao gold smuggling controversy: What India's customs rules say",
    "body": "Kannada actor Ranya Rao was caught at Bengaluru&rsquo;s Kempegowda International Airport with 14.8 kg of gold, marking one of the largest gold seizures in recent times. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) uncovered the smuggling operation just before she cleared airport security.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following searches at locations linked to her led to the recovery of gold jewellery worth Rs 2.06 crore and Rs 2.67 crore in cash. Rao was presented before an economic offences court, which sent her to judicial custody for 14 days. Over the past year, she reportedly made 30 trips to Saudi Arabia, wearing the same outfit each time while smuggling gold. She is the stepdaughter of senior IPS officer Ramachandra Rao, a DGP-rank officer currently serving as the chairman and managing director of the Karnataka State Police Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd.&nbsp;Indian Customs Act of 1962The Indian Customs Act of 1962 is a foundational legislation that governs the import and export of goods in India. It plays a crucial role in regulating international trade, safeguarding the economy, and preventing smuggling. The Act is administered by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), which is part of the Ministry of Finance.&nbsp;The Customs Act of 1962 is divided into 17 chapters, covering various aspects of customs regulations such as duties on imported goods, prohibitions on imports and exports, warehousing, and penalties. It aims to facilitate legal trade while preventing unauthorised activities like smuggling.&nbsp;Key provisions under the Act-Customs duty: The Act imposes customs duty on goods imported into or exported from India. The rates of duty are specified under the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, or other applicable laws. Customs duty serves multiple purposes, including protecting domestic industries and conserving foreign exchange.&nbsp;-Prohibitions and restrictions: The Act empowers the government to prohibit or restrict the import and export of certain goods. This is crucial for safeguarding national security, public health, and environmental concerns.&nbsp;-Clearance procedures: Importers and exporters must comply with customs clearance procedures, which involve documenting goods, paying applicable duties, and obtaining necessary permissions. This ensures that goods comply with regulatory requirements.&nbsp;-Warehousing: Goods can be stored in warehouses without immediate payment of duty, allowing importers to defer duty payment until goods are cleared for consumption or re-export.&nbsp;Mandatory requirements-Customs declaration: All passengers entering India must pass through customs checks and may need to complete a customs declaration form if they are carrying dutiable goods. Passengers can declare dutiable goods and currency in advance using the ATITHI mobile app before boarding. If carrying foreign currency notes worth more than $5,000 or a total foreign exchange amount exceeding $10,000, a declaration is mandatory.&nbsp;-Documentation: Importers and exporters must provide detailed documentation of goods, including their value, origin, and classification under the Harmonised System (HS) code.&nbsp;-Payment of duty: Duty must be paid on all imported goods unless exempted by law. The duty rates vary based on the type of goods and their country of origin.&nbsp;Allowances for passengersDomestic flightsFor domestic flights within India, there are generally no customs restrictions or allowances since passengers are not crossing international borders. However, passengers must comply with airline regulations regarding baggage limits and prohibited items.&nbsp;International flightsDuty-free allowances: Passengers arriving in India are entitled to certain duty-free allowances:&gt;Used personal items and travel souvenirs: These are allowed duty-free.&gt;Articles up to Rs 15,000: For passengers arriving from Nepal, Bhutan, or Myanmar.&gt;General allowance: International passengers can bring goods worth up to Rs. 50,000 duty-free, provided they are not carrying prohibited items.&nbsp;Specific items&gt;Laptop, computers: One laptop per passenger aged 18 and above is allowed duty-free&gt;Alcoholic liquor: Up to 2 litres of liquor is allowed duty-free&gt;Tobacco products: Up to 100 cigarettes or 25 cigars or 125 gm of tobacco are allowed duty-free&nbsp;Gold and silver&gt;NRIs are allowed to bring up to 10,000 gm of gold to India once every six months, provided they have resided abroad for a minimum of six months. However, only a part of this allowance is exempt from duty, while the rest is subject to customs charges.&gt;A male passenger can bring 20 gm of gold with a value limit of Rs 50,000&gt;A female passenger can bring 40 gm of gold with a value limit of Rs 1,00,000&gt;Children can bring 20/40 gm of gold with a value limit of Rs 50,000/Rs 1,00,000 based on gender&nbsp;Cash carrying limit&gt;Passengers can bring Indian currency up to Rs 25,000 without declaration. However, foreign currency must be declared if exceeding $5,000 or its equivalent.&nbsp;Punishment for smugglingSmuggling is a serious offense under the Customs Act of 1962. Penalties for smuggling include:&gt;Imprisonment: Smugglers can face imprisonment ranging from three to seven years, depending on the severity of the offense.&gt;Fines: In addition to imprisonment, smugglers may be fined, with the amount often being three times the value of the goods involved.&gt;Confiscation of goods: Smuggled goods are liable to be confiscated by customs authorities.",

    "title": "Excessive competition within China: Why leaders are worried about 'Neijuan'",
    "body": "Chinese Premier Li Qiang, during his address of the annual work report to the National People&rsquo;s Congress (NPC) on Wednesday, vowed to launch a &ldquo;comprehensive crackdown&rdquo; on &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; &ndash; a term referring to excessive, self-defeating competition.&nbsp; This marks a significant moment in China, as the concept has now been officially acknowledged by a top official at one of China&rsquo;s most important political events of the country.&nbsp;As China&rsquo;s economy slows, the government is pushing to create a more sustainable business environment while also countering international criticism over its industrial policies. Here is a closer examination of the industrial competition in China and how &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; comes into play.&nbsp;What is Neijuan?The term &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; best translates to &lsquo;involution&rsquo; and can be better understood as &lsquo;involutionary competition&rsquo;. It describes a cycle of diminishing returns caused by intense competition. In simple terms, it means companies and individuals are forced to work harder and invest more, without seeing proportional benefits or returns.&nbsp;In business, this means companies slashing prices and overproducing to stay ahead, even if it hurts profitability.&nbsp;For workers, it describes a relentless rat race where individuals must continuously upskill, work long hours, and compete fiercely &ndash; without necessarily improving their quality of life.&nbsp;Chinese crack down on NeijuanNeijuan has been particularly visible in China&rsquo;s booming industries, where companies are undercutting each other in price wars, leading to lower profits and unsustainable business practices. The electric vehicle (EV) sector is a prime example, with fierce competition among brands driving aggressive price cuts.&nbsp;Response of Chinese govtThis is not the first time China&rsquo;s leaders have spoken about &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo;, but it is the first time it has been included in an official government work report. Over the past year, Beijing has intensified efforts to curb excessive competition and encourage more sustainable economic growth.&nbsp;Policy reforms: China aims to eliminate market fragmentation and local protectionism, making it easier for businesses to compete fairly.&nbsp;Stricter regulations: The government has pledged to crack down on destructive competition, ensuring industries focus on innovation rather than just price wars.&nbsp;Meetings with key industries: China&rsquo;s market regulator recently called in top companies from the technology, solar, and automotive sectors to discuss solutions for controlling &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo;.&nbsp;Promoting &lsquo;new quality productive forces&rsquo;: Beijing is shifting focus to high-tech sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles, and batteries, but overproduction remains a challenge.&nbsp;&ldquo;China will accelerate the establishment and improvement of fundamental institutional rules, eliminate local protectionism and market fragmentation, and remove bottlenecks in market entry and exit as well as resource allocation,&rdquo; Li stated during his address.&nbsp;Global competition ups pressure on Chinese firmsThe crackdown on &lsquo;Neijuan&rsquo; also comes amid rising tensions with the US and the European Union (EU). Western nations have accused China of &lsquo;dumping&rsquo; excess capacity into global markets, selling products at extremely low prices, which they claim is hurting their domestic industries.&nbsp;China, however, rejects these accusations, arguing that its industrial expansion is driven by innovation and genuine demand, not unfair trade practices. However, Beijing&rsquo;s increasing focus on regulating its industries suggests that even Chinese leaders are recognising the risks of unchecked competition.",

    "title": "Bai Lan movement: Why Chinese youth are 'lying flat' and 'letting it rot'",
    "body": "China&rsquo;s youth unemployment rate has been a growing concern due to the country&rsquo;s prolonged economic slowdown. While there are signs of improvement led by targeted government efforts, a shift in attitude towards &lsquo;work&rsquo; among young Chinese has gained momentum over the past few years. While the west grapples with notions of &lsquo;quiet quitting&rsquo; or &lsquo;quiet vacationing&rsquo;, the shift on the east is best represented by the &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Let it rot&rsquo; movement, where young people are actively rejecting societal pressures to overwork and pursue conventional success.&nbsp;The &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; movement seems to stem from the &lsquo;Tang Ping&rsquo; movement, which gained prominence in 2021. Here is a look at how the youth of China have been dealing with disappointing market conditions over the last few years.&nbsp;What is &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo;?The term &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; literally means &ldquo;let it rot&rdquo;. It describes a mindset of voluntary retreat, where individuals choose not to fight against a difficult situation because they believe it is beyond their control. The phrase reflects growing disillusionment among young Chinese who feel that despite their efforts, economic and social success remains out of reach.&nbsp;This movement is closely related to another trend called &ldquo;Tang Ping&rdquo;, or &ldquo;lying flat&rdquo;. First gaining prominence in 2021, Tang Ping represents a rejection of excessive ambition and relentless work culture. Those who embrace it refuse to chase high-paying, high-stress jobs, instead opting for a low-desire lifestyle where they work only enough to meet their basic needs.&nbsp;Why are Chinese youth embracing &lsquo;Bai Lan&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tang Ping&rsquo;?According to media reports, several key factors explain the rise of these movements:&nbsp;Harsh job market: With high youth unemployment and an uncertain economy, many young people see little benefit in striving for career success.&nbsp;The 996 work culture: Many white-collar workers face a brutal schedule of 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, yet still struggle to afford housing, marriage, or a better quality of life.&nbsp;Soaring cost of living: Skyrocketing property prices and living expenses make it difficult for young people to achieve financial security.&nbsp;Lack of upward mobility: Many believe that no matter how hard they work, real success remains out of reach, especially for those from middle and lower-income backgrounds.&nbsp;For some, Bai Lan and Tang Ping are acts of silent resistance &ndash; a way to push back against societal expectations that demand endless productivity while offering little in return.&nbsp;How has the Chinese govt responded?China&rsquo;s leadership sees Bai Lan and Tang Ping as serious threats to economic growth and social stability. The government has responded with:Public campaigns promoting hard work: Officials have repeatedly emphasised the importance of hard work, ambition, and dedication to China&rsquo;s future.Job creation and policy reforms: Efforts to boost employment opportunities and encourage entrepreneurship and innovation are being introduced.Education reforms: Authorities are considering ways to align education with evolving job markets, pushing students towards practical and diverse career paths.However, these measures have met with mixed reactions. While some believe they are necessary to stabilise the economy, others argue that they are outdated solutions that fail to address the frustrations of young people.&nbsp;To motivate the youth, President Xi Jinping, in 2022, delivered an address outlining the role of the youth in &lsquo;national rejuvenation&rsquo;. He called on young people to channel their energy and creativity to the nation&rsquo;s development, emphasising their role in achieving the &lsquo;Chinese Dream&rsquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;For generations of youths in the new era, the time could not be better for them to complete weighty tasks since they have an incomparably broad stage to display their talents and brighter prospects than ever before to realise their dreams,&rdquo; Jinping said.&nbsp;Is a larger cultural shift at play in China?The Bai Lan movement is not just about unemployment, it signals a major cultural shift in how young Chinese view work, success, and personal happiness.&nbsp;Traditional values that once emphasised stable jobs, marriage, and children are now being questioned, reflecting changing family and social expectations. Social media platforms, like Weibo and Douyin (China&rsquo;s version of TikTok), have also played a role in spreading the Bai Lan mindset, connecting like-minded individuals who embrace this outlook.&nbsp;However, if more young people continue to opt out of the workforce or reject the pursuit of high-paying careers, it could have long-term economic consequences, deepening challenges and widening income disparities.&nbsp;What is the unemployment rate in China?China&rsquo;s youth unemployment rate, which soared to a record high of 21.3 per cent in June 2023 due to a prolonged economic slowdown, has shown signs of improvement in recent months. Official data indicates that the rate declined for the third consecutive month in November 2024, suggesting a gradual easing of pressure in the job market. However, uncertainty among the youth appears to persist.&nbsp;On Wednesday, the Chinese government reported that in 2024, the country successfully created 12.56 million new urban jobs, achieving its annual goal. Earlier, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of China noted that the surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 per cent last year, a slight improvement from 2023.&nbsp;For 2025, China has set its surveyed urban unemployment rate target at around 5.5 per cent.&nbsp;Despite these positive indicators, broader demographic challenges remain. For instance, marriage registrations in 2024 fell to their lowest level since 1980, reflecting deeper population concerns that could have long-term economic implications.&nbsp;",

With a focus on education, career growth, earning potential, and economic mobility, the report reveals that countries offering structured pathways to residency and citizenship are becoming increasingly sought after by families who view strategic relocation as key to wealth planning and career advancement.&nbsp;&quot;&ldquo;While studies confirm that tertiary graduates earn around 50% more than those with only secondary education, research also reveals that over two-thirds of income disparity worldwide is dictated by the country in which an individual lives and works. With barriers to opportunity often dictated by the limitations of our citizenship, the index makes a compelling case for investment migration as a game-changing strategy for families looking to transcend the constraints of their &lsquo;birthright lottery&rsquo;&quot; said Tess Wilkinson, Director of Henley & Partners Education.&nbsp;The Singapore Global Investor Program is popular among ultra-high-net-worth families, and the city-state is well-established as a world-class education destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;The US, with its EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program offering an efficient route to permanent resident status and new &ldquo;gold card&rdquo; visa proposed, which would offer wealthy investors the right to live and work in the US and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for a $5 million investment, is not far behind on 78%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia, which recently launched a new National Innovation Visa, comes in next with 76%, ahead of Canada, which offers a popular Start-Up Visa Program for entrepreneurs and scores 73%, rounding up the Top 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The UK, which has an Innovator Founder Visa requiring individuals to set up a new, scaling business in the country, secures an opportunity score of 70% when it comes to providing strategic advantage to its citizens and residents, and the UAE, which has numerous categories of beneficiaries for its Golden Residence visa, earns 67%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Austria, which requires a substantial contribution to its economy to secure citizenship, and New Zealand, which recently eased the rules for its Active Investor Plus Visa Program to incentivize investors, each achieve 65%, closely followed by Italy, which also offers an Investor Visa and scores 64% on the Henley Opportunity Index.&nbsp;Further down the list evaluating the possibility of future success is the cosmopolitan wealth hub of Hong Kong, which reintroduced its Capital Investment Entrant Scheme in 2024 and scores 61%, just ahead of rising star Latvia, whose residence by investment offering is one of the fastest and most competitive programs in Europe and scores 60%.&nbsp; Next is Malta, which offers an attractive pathway that allows for the granting of citizenship by a certificate of naturalization to foreign individuals and their families who contribute to the country&rsquo;s economic development, scoring 59%.&nbsp; Hungary, which offers a Guest Investor Residence Permit, follows with an opportunity score of 58%. Greece and Portugal, both scoring 56%, round out the rankings, with Greece&rsquo;s Golden Visa Program shooting up in popularity in the past 12 months, while Portugal&rsquo;s Golden Residence Permit Program has long been favored by investors from across the globe.&nbsp;&quot;By investing in these residence and citizenship programs, families can permanently relocate to regions that offer exceptional educational opportunities, professional development, and high-quality living standards. This significantly enhances earning potential and facilitates wealth creation across generations,&quot; said Wilkinson.&nbsp;&nbsp;She explains this with the following examples:&nbsp;A Vietnamese family with an opportunity score of just 29% in their home country could elevate their next generation&rsquo;s potential success to 78% by securing US residence through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program. Similarly, an Indian family with a 37% score could boost their advantage to 84% by relocating to Switzerland via the Swiss Residence Program. In another example, a Nigerian family with a mere 21% opportunity score could dramatically increase their life chances to 79% by obtaining residence through Singapore&rsquo;s Global Investor Program, securing a remarkable advantage. Additionally, investment migration routes such as the UAE&rsquo;s Golden Visa and New Zealand&rsquo;s Active Investor Plus Visa offer next-generation opportunity advantages of 67% and 65%, respectively.&nbsp;&quot;Filipino investors leveraging Canada&rsquo;s Start-Up Visa Program would experience significant improvements in multiple aspects of their lives. Access to premium education would see a rise from a score of 32 out of 100 in the Philippines to 73 in Canada. Earning potential would also grow substantially, improving from 34 to 66. Career advancement opportunities would witness an even greater jump, surging from 35 to 74. Economic mobility would skyrocket from just 10 in the Philippines to 75 in Canada, and the family&rsquo;s total opportunity score would increase from 31% to 73%,&quot; said Henley & Partners in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "title": "Delimitation explained: Why Stalin wants people to have more kids in TN",
    "body": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin has reignited the debate on delimitation by urging a newlywed couple to plan a family early, linking it to securing Tamil Nadu&rsquo;s advantage in the upcoming exercise.&nbsp;This raises a question &mdash; why are southern states apprehensive about delimitation? To understand this, we need to first understand what delimitation is, how it works, and why it has become a contentious issue.&nbsp;What is delimitation?&nbsp;Delimitation is the process of redrawing the boundaries of parliamentary and state assembly constituencies to reflect demographic changes. It ensures that electoral representation aligns with population shifts and determines how many seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), reported India Today.&nbsp;The principle behind delimitation is to maintain equitable representation, preventing densely populated regions from being underrepresented while ensuring sparsely populated areas are not overrepresented. The core philosophy is the democratic ideal of &ldquo;one person, one vote, one value.&rdquo;&nbsp;Why and how is delimitation done?&nbsp;The process of delimitation is mandated by Articles 82 and 170 of the Indian Constitution, which require the number of parliamentary and assembly seats to be revised based on the most recent census. The task is executed by the Delimitation Commission, a body established through a law passed by Parliament.&nbsp;However, delimitation is not merely a mechanical exercise of redrawing maps&mdash;it has deep political implications. Since seats are allocated based on population, states with higher population growth could gain more seats, while those with lower population growth could see their representation shrink.&nbsp;History of delimitation in India&nbsp;India has conducted delimitation exercises three times&mdash;in 1951, 1961, and 1971&mdash;before freezing the process to encourage population control.&nbsp;Growth of Lok Sabha seats over timeCensus year&nbsp;Lok Sabha seatsPopulation1951&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;494361 million&nbsp;1961&nbsp;&nbsp;522&nbsp;439 million1971&nbsp;543548 million&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1976, the government, amid an aggressive family planning campaign, froze delimitation for 25 years through the 42nd Amendment Act to prevent states with higher population growth from gaining an unfair advantage. This freeze was extended again in 2001 by the 84th Amendment Act, postponing delimitation until 2026.&nbsp;Today, the 543 Lok Sabha seats and 250 Rajya Sabha seats remain based on 1971 census figures, even though constituency boundaries and SC/ST reservations were adjusted in 2001.&nbsp;The upcoming delimitation and its potential impact&nbsp;The 2031 Census will likely guide the next delimitation exercise, redrawing boundaries and altering the number of parliamentary seats allocated to states. However, with the 2021 Census delayed, discussions on delimitation have already begun in anticipation of the 2026 deadline.&nbsp;How could delimitation change representation?&nbsp;Delimitation can result in increased, decreased, or adjusted constituencies without necessarily changing the total number of parliamentary seats. However, projections suggest that if the current population trends are followed, the number of Lok Sabha seats may increase from 543 to 753.&nbsp;Current representation of Southern states&nbsp;Currently, southern states hold 129 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats:&nbsp;Telangana: 17 seatsAndhra Pradesh: 25 seatsKerala: 20 seatsTamil Nadu: 39 seatsKarnataka: 28 seats&nbsp;This accounts for 24 per cent of Lok Sabha representation.&nbsp;Projected representation after delimitation&nbsp;If the total number of Lok Sabha seats increases to 753, the South&rsquo;s share could drop to 19 per cent.&nbsp;Telangana: 20 seatsAndhra Pradesh: 28 seatsKerala: 19 seatsTamil Nadu: 41 seatsKarnataka: 36 seats&nbsp;In contrast, northern states&mdash;especially Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan&mdash;are expected to gain significant seats:&nbsp;Uttar Pradesh: From 80 to 128 seatsBihar: From 40 to 70 seatsMadhya Pradesh: From 29 to 47 seatsMaharashtra: From 48 to 68 seatsRajasthan: From 25 to 44 seats&nbsp;This shift is at the heart of the southern states&rsquo; concerns.&nbsp;Tamil Nadu&rsquo;s stance on delimitation&nbsp;Chief Minister MK Stalin has called delimitation an issue that affects all of South India. He argued that states that have successfully implemented population control and economic development should not be penalised with reduced representation.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is because a situation has now arisen, according to which only a higher population would ensure more MPs as the delimitation exercise would be on the basis of population,&quot; Stalin was quoted as saying by The Indian Express.&nbsp; &quot;Tamil Nadu paid attention to population control and succeeded and that was the reason for the state&rsquo;s plight today,&quot; he added.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will not tell you to not have children hastily, have children immediately; but give them beautiful Tamil names,&rdquo; he said, while attending the wedding function of a DMK district secretary at Nagapattinam.&nbsp;Why Are Southern states opposing delimitation?&nbsp;1. Reduced political influence&nbsp;If delimitation is based purely on population, the South&rsquo;s parliamentary strength could shrink from 24 per cent to 19 per cent, while Hindi-speaking states would gain about 60 per cent representation.&nbsp;2. Economic contribution vs representation&nbsp;States like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Maharashtra are among India&rsquo;s largest contributors to direct tax revenue, but they receive only 30 per cent of their contributions in return. Meanwhile, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh receive 250-350 per cent more than what they contribute. Southern states argue that representation should factor in economic contribution, not just population size.&nbsp;3. Women&rsquo;s Reservation Act & SC/ST reservations&nbsp;The Women&rsquo;s Reservation Act, which mandates 33 per cent reservation for women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies, will also influence delimitation. Additionally, SC/ST seat reservations will be reviewed, adding complexity to the process.",

    "title": "What are capital gains tax: Are they the Indian govt's 'biggest mistake'?",
    "body": "India&rsquo;s decision to impose capital gains tax on foreign investors has sparked intense debate, with market veteran Samir Arora calling it the government&rsquo;s &ldquo;biggest mistake&rdquo;. Arora, founder and chief investment officer of Helios Capital, voiced his concerns at the Business Standard Manthan Summit 2025, arguing that the tax policy is discouraging foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and driving them away from Indian markets.&nbsp;But why is it causing investor concerns? To grasp the issue, it&rsquo;s important to understand what capital gains tax is and how it works.&nbsp;What is capital gains tax?When individuals or entities sell certain capital assets &ndash; such as stocks, mutual funds, property, gold, or other investments &ndash; they make a capital gain (profit) on the sale. If these assets were held for over a year, the profit is classified as a long-term capital gain and is taxed accordingly.&nbsp;What are the types of capital gains tax?Capital gains tax is categorised into short-term capital gains (STCG) and long-term capital gains (LTCG), depending on the holding period of the asset.&nbsp;Short-term capital gains (STCG): This tax applies when an asset is sold within a short duration after purchase. It is generally taxed at a higher rate.&nbsp;Long-term capital gains (LTCG): This tax applies when an asset is held for an extended period before being sold. It is typically taxed at a lower rate to encourage long-term investment.&nbsp;What is the STCG in India?STCG apply when assets like stocks, mutual funds, real estate, or other capital assets are sold within a short holding period &mdash; typically less than one year for equities and less than two years for real estate.&nbsp;In India, STCG on equity-oriented investments (where Securities Transaction Tax is paid) is taxed at 15 per cent, while STCG from other assets is taxed as per the investor&rsquo;s income tax slab rate.&nbsp;How to calculate STCG?Short-term capital gains (STCG) are calculated by subtracting the cost of acquisition, cost of improvement (if any), and any expenses related to the sale from the selling price of the asset. The formula is:STCG = Sale Price &ndash; (Purchase Price + Improvement Cost + Transfer Expenses)&nbsp;What is the LTCG in India?In India, LTCG on stocks and equity-oriented mutual funds is taxed at 12.5 per cent (plus surcharge and cess) for profits exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh per year. However, LTCG was not applicable on equity until 2018 for gains up to Rs 1 lakh.&nbsp;The Union Budget 2024-25 introduced a major shift in capital gains taxation, increasing the LTCG tax rate to 12.5 per cent from 10 per cent and eliminating the indexation benefit that previously allowed investors to adjust the purchase price of assets for inflation.&nbsp;Last year&rsquo;s Budget also called for equal tax treatment for foreign and domestic investors. There are no changes to the taxation of long-term capital gains (LTCG) derived from residential property in the new Income Tax Bill 2025.&nbsp;How to calculate LTCGThe taxable amount under LTCG is determined by subtracting the cost of acquisition from the sale price, and in the case of property or other high-value assets, certain transaction costs like brokerage or legal fees can be deducted before applying the tax.&nbsp;Why are investors worried?The elimination of indexation benefits has been particularly controversial. Previously, indexation allowed taxpayers to adjust the purchase price of an asset for inflation, effectively reducing taxable gains. By removing this benefit, the new tax structure could increase the tax burden on investors, especially those selling property, gold, and unlisted assets.&nbsp;Foreign investors, in particular, have been hit hard by these changes. Speaking at the Business Standard annual summit Arora of Helios Capital argued that sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) &ndash; which form a significant portion of foreign investment &ndash; are now disincentivised from investing in India.&nbsp;&ldquo;The biggest mistake they (the government) have made, the biggest souring of sentiment, and reality which they have to accept is capital gains tax in India, particularly the foreign investors, is 100 per cent wrong,&rdquo; Arora said. &ldquo;The largest investors in the world and in India are foreign sovereign funds, pension funds, universities, and the HNIs. Taxing them on their gains, especially when they have no tax set-off available in their home country and when they face forex-related risks, is a big mistake that the government is making.&rdquo;&nbsp;How has this impacted the Indian market?Since October 2024, foreign investors have pulled out over Rs 2 trillion from Indian equities, according to a report by The Times of India. Several factors have contributed to this trend such as:&gt;Higher capital gains tax rates making Indian investments less appealing.&gt;Weak corporate earnings growth reducing investor confidence.&gt;The falling rupee, which erodes returns when converted back to foreign currencies.&gt;Stronger US markets, where higher bond yields and lower tax burdens offer better returns.&nbsp;Arora had also mentioned that the Indian government had earned $10-11 billion dollars as capital gains tax in 2022-23 (FY23).&nbsp;How does India&rsquo;s capital gains tax compare to other countries?Australia: Currently 50 per cent of capital gains are taxable if an asset is held for more than 12 months, taxed at regular personal income tax rates.&nbsp;Canada: Currently 50 per cent of capital gains are taxable, rising to two-thirds for gains exceeding CAD 2,50,000 from 24 June 2024.&nbsp;China: No tax on capital gains from shares listed on Chinese stock exchanges. However, a 20 per cent flat tax applies to other capital asset transfers, including securities and real estate.&nbsp;Germany: 25 per cent tax, plus a 5.5 per cent solidarity surcharge and 8-9 per cent church tax, depending on the federal state.&nbsp;United Arab Emirates: No capital gains tax.&nbsp;United Kingdom: Capital gains are taxed at rates of up to 20 per cent (excluding property), up to 24 per cent on residential property, and up to 28 per cent on carried interest gains. The UK also provides an annual tax-free exemption of GBP 3,000.&nbsp;United States: A progressive LTCG tax system, with rates of 0 per cent, 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, depending on taxable income and filing status. A 3.8 per cent Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) applies to high-income earners.",

    "title": "Trump wants Ukraine's rare minerals: What makes them so valuable?",
    "body": "Ukraine&rsquo;s vast mineral reserves have taken centre stage in international negotiations. US President Donald Trump is pushing for a deal that would give the US partial access to the country&rsquo;s resources.&nbsp;Trump has said that Ukraine&rsquo;s mineral wealth could be worth &ldquo;trillions of dollars&rdquo; and suggested that it should be used to offset the cost of US aid. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has described the country&rsquo;s resources as &ldquo;priceless&rdquo; and is seeking security guarantees as part of any agreement.&nbsp;The growing demand for critical minerals and the global race to reduce reliance on China have heightened interest in Ukraine&rsquo;s deposits. But what are these minerals in Ukraine and what are they worth?&nbsp;What minerals does Ukraine have?Ukraine is believed to hold reserves of several rare earth elements, which are key materials used in military, technology, and renewable energy industries.&nbsp;Role of rare earth minerals in the militaryRare earths, a group of 17 chemically similar elements, are essential for manufacturing missiles, lasers, tanks, smartphones, and clean energy technologies.&nbsp;China currently dominates global rare earth processing, making alternative sources, such as those in Ukraine, particularly significant. However, while Ukraine is known to have some rare earth deposits, the full extent of these resources is unclear. Geological data from the Soviet era is outdated, and further surveys are needed to confirm the size and viability of these reserves.&nbsp;Scandium, one of Ukraine&rsquo;s rare earth elements, is used in military equipment and high-performance materials. Other rare earths found in the country include neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and yttrium, all of which are crucial for advanced technologies.&nbsp;What other critical minerals does Ukraine have?Beyond rare earths, Ukraine has reserves of several other critical minerals essential for defence and industrial production. These include:Titanium &ndash; Used in aerospace manufacturing and military applicationsGraphite &ndash; A key material in batteries and electric vehiclesLithium &ndash; Vital for rechargeable batteries and clean energy storageUranium &ndash; Crucial for nuclear energy production&nbsp;Ukraine&rsquo;s hydrocarbon resources lie in occupied regionsIn addition to minerals, Ukraine has significant oil, natural gas, and coal reserves. However, much of its hydrocarbon wealth is in regions currently occupied by Russia. This includes offshore natural gas reserves near Crimea and coal deposits in eastern Ukraine. More than half of Ukraine&rsquo;s coal reserves and about 20 per cent of its natural gas fields are under Russian control.&nbsp;Moscow has even hinted at the possibility of granting the US access to these resources, further complicating negotiations.&nbsp;What are Ukraine&rsquo;s rare mineral reserves worth?Economists estimate that Ukraine&rsquo;s hydrocarbon resources alone could be worth around $360 billion, as reported by NBC News. Meanwhile, broader estimates suggest that the country&rsquo;s total mineral and natural resource wealth could be valued in the trillions of dollars.&nbsp;As far as the rare earth minerals are concerned, extraction and processing challenges mean that the economic potential and exact value of these resources remains difficult to estimate.&nbsp;Trump has claimed that Ukraine could provide the US with $500 billion worth of rare earth minerals, but industry analysts dispute this figure. The entire global market for rare earths is estimated to be worth just $12 billion, according to NBC News, making Trump&rsquo;s valuation unrealistic.&nbsp;While Ukraine is known to have some rare earth deposits, the full extent of these resources is unclear.&nbsp; Much of the country&rsquo;s geological data dates back to the Soviet era and is considered unreliable. New surveys are needed to determine the full extent of Ukraine&rsquo;s rare earth deposits.&nbsp;Mining minerals: A major challenge in UkraineWhile Ukraine&rsquo;s mineral wealth is attracting international interest, realising its full economic potential will not be straightforward. Extracting and processing these resources requires stable infrastructure, secure supply chains, and long-term investment, including rebuilding Ukraine&rsquo;s war-damaged power grid. The war in Ukraine has disrupted much of the country&rsquo;s industrial capacity, and restoring it will be a lengthy and expensive process.&nbsp;At present, no large-scale rare earth projects are underway in the country, and media reports estimate that it could take up to a decade to establish a functioning supply chain.&nbsp;Why does the US want Ukraine&rsquo;s rare minerals?Global competition for critical minerals has intensified, particularly as the transition to clean energy and advanced technology accelerates. Countries such as the US and European nations are looking to reduce their reliance on China for rare earth processing, and Ukraine&rsquo;s resources could play a role in diversifying supply chains.&nbsp;China currently dominates global rare earth processing, making alternative sources, such as those in Ukraine, particularly significant.&nbsp;Securing access to Ukraine&rsquo;s mineral wealth could help the US reduce its dependence on China and Russia, both of which dominate global critical mineral supply chains. Washington has long viewed this reliance as a strategic vulnerability, particularly in light of geopolitical tensions. For Ukraine, leveraging its mineral wealth could bring economic benefits &ndash; but only if the right agreements are in place.&nbsp;During their meeting in Washington, the two leaders were expected to work out the details of a potential minerals deal. While their positions on the terms of the agreement differ &ndash; particularly on security commitments &ndash; both US and Ukrainian officials were keen to secure access to Ukraine&rsquo;s resources.&nbsp;Moscow has even hinted at the possibility of granting the US access to Ukraine&rsquo;s resources, further complicating negotiations.&nbsp;",

    "title": "MMRDA-Systra dispute: Payment held, contract cut, French Embassy steps in",
    "body": "The Bombay High Court has overturned the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority&rsquo;s (MMRDA) decision to terminate its contract with French company Systra MVA Consulting (India) Pvt Ltd, which was providing consultancy services for three metro lines in Mumbai. The court ruled that the termination was &ldquo;arbitrary and unfair&rdquo; and directed MMRDA to reconsider its decision after giving Systra a fair hearing.&nbsp;Here&#39;s a closer look at the contract, dispute, termination, and next steps.&nbsp;Systra&rsquo;s work in MumbaiSystra has played a significant role in Mumbai&rsquo;s metro rail expansion, providing consultancy services for civil works on metro lines 5, 9, and 7A. Additionally, the company has contributed to the detailed design of metro lines 2, 4, and 7, branding guidelines for MMRDA&rsquo;s metro network, and other key transport infrastructure projects, including the Mumbai Coastal Road.&nbsp;What is the MMRDA-Systra dispute?The dispute arose from a contract awarded to Systra-SMCIPL Consortium, in which Systra holds a 70 per cent stake, for general and design consultancy services for Mumbai metro lines 5 (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan), 7A [Andheri (East)-CSIA], and 9 (Mira Bhayander).&nbsp;MMRDA had invited bids for the consultancy role in February 2020, and Systra won the contract in June 2020 with a bid of Rs 90.76 crore. The company was formally appointed as the general consultant for system works in May 2021. Initially, the consultancy agreement was set for 42 months, concluding in November 2024. However, it was later extended to December 2026.&nbsp;MMRDA suspends payments, terminates contractThe conflict began in early 2024 when MMRDA suspended payments to Systra for its consultancy work on Mumbai Metro projects.&nbsp;The dispute escalated in November 2024 when Systra, through a letter routed via the French Embassy, accused MMRDA officials of corruption, undue pressure, and payment delays. The French firm claimed that the harassment intensified after leadership changes at MMRDA in August 2023.&nbsp;On January 3, 2025, MMRDA issued a notice informing Systra of its decision to discontinue its services.&nbsp;Systra challenges termination noticeSystra, represented by senior advocate Venkatesh Dhond, challenged the termination, arguing that the notice was not in accordance with the contract terms and lacked justification. The firm contended that MMRDA had failed to provide any reasons for the termination, making its decision arbitrary and unfair.&nbsp;MMRDA&rsquo;s claims against SystraDefending MMRDA&rsquo;s stance, senior advocate and Maharashtra Advocate General Birendra Saraf maintained that the termination was well within the general contract conditions, which allowed MMRDA to end the agreement without citing reasons. He also argued that Systra&rsquo;s plea was misconceived and that the company should seek arbitration instead.&nbsp;In a detailed 28-page statement, MMRDA dismissed Systra&rsquo;s corruption allegations as &quot;baseless,&quot; stating that the French embassy merely forwarded the letter without endorsing its claims. The agency also pointed out that Systra&rsquo;s accusations surfaced only after payment suspensions were issued.&nbsp;Further, MMRDA accused Systra of multiple contractual violations, including labour law breaches, unauthorised staffing at metro sites, and security lapses involving sensitive project data. It cited safety failures as well, referencing a fatal accident involving a transit mixer operator in December 2024.&nbsp;MMRDA defended its decision to suspend payments for the civil consultancy contract on metro lines 5, 9, and 7A, arguing that these projects were already in advanced execution stages. However, it revoked suspension orders for other contracts after Systra acknowledged breaches and submitted remedial plans.&nbsp;Bombay HC ruling on MMRDA-Systra disputeThe Bombay High Court, however, disagreed with MMRDA&rsquo;s reasoning. It ruled that while the contract permitted termination without specifying reasons, this clause could not be interpreted as granting MMRDA the unrestricted right to act arbitrarily.&nbsp;A division bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Arif S Doctor issued the ruling on Tuesday, quashing the notice sent by MMRDA in January that ended Systra&rsquo;s consultancy contract. However, the court did not grant Systra&rsquo;s request for specific performance, meaning it did not compel MMRDA to reinstate the contract but only mandated a fresh decision-making process.&nbsp;The judges also stated that since they had already concluded MMRDA&rsquo;s actions were arbitrary, there was no need to examine the contract&rsquo;s nature in detail. Furthermore, they dismissed MMRDA&rsquo;s argument that Systra should pursue arbitration, affirming that the authority&rsquo;s conduct did not warrant such a course of action.&nbsp;What now?With the court&rsquo;s decision, MMRDA must now re-evaluate Systra&rsquo;s contract, ensuring due process is followed. However, the legal battle does not impact ongoing metro construction work, according to MMRDA sources, as cited by The Print. The outcome of this reassessment could determine whether Systra continues its involvement in Mumbai&rsquo;s Metro development or if further legal and contractual challenges arise.&nbsp;(With agency inputs)&nbsp;",

    "title": "Decoded: Why beverage giants are pushing against govt's new PET bottle rule",
    "body": "&nbsp;Leading beverage manufacturers are considering legal options against the Indian government&rsquo;s directive mandating the use of 30 per cent recycled food-grade PET (rPET) bottles starting April 1, 2025. Industry executives argue that the deadline is impractical,&nbsp;highlighting challenges such as recycling infrastructure, material shortages, and cost concerns, especially with peak summer demand approaching, according to a report by&nbsp;The Economic Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverage giants including Coca-Cola, Pepsi Co, Bisleri, and Parle Agro are all impacted by these stringent deadlines.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) issued this directive over two years ago as part of India&rsquo;s Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules. However, beverage companies contend that the industry is not adequately prepared for the transition, despite the extended timeline.&nbsp;PET vs rPET bottlesPET, or polyethylene terephthalate, and rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate) are both widely used in packaging and textiles, but they differ significantly in their environmental impact and production process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PET is a durable, lightweight plastic commonly found in beverage bottles, food containers, and synthetic fibres. Its strength and recyclability make it a popular choice, but it is primarily produced from fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas, making its manufacturing process resource-intensive and environmentally demanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, rPET is an eco-friendlier alternative derived from recycled PET products. Post-consumer PET waste, such as plastic bottles, is collected, cleaned, and processed into flakes, which are then melted and repurposed into rPET pellets or resin. These materials are used to create new products like rPET packaging, rPET sheets, and rPET polyester fabrics, reducing reliance on virgin plastics and minimising waste.&nbsp;What is the govt mandate on PET bottles?To incentivise domestic recycling, India banned the import of plastic waste, including PET bottles in 2015. By 2016, however, the ban was amended, allowing plastic waste imports only for units located in special economic zones (SEZs).&nbsp;The Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules, 2016 banned plastic sachets used for gutkha, tobacco, and pan masala due to high littering potential. Additionally, states/UTs were asked to form special task forces for eliminating single-use plastics (SUPs).&nbsp;Plastic packaging producers, e-commerce firms, and major SUPs users were directed to phase out SUPs. Compliance varied by state/UT, with some implementing partial bans while others enforced a complete ban.&nbsp;In 2019, the Environment Ministry imposed a full ban on plastic waste imports to strengthen India&rsquo;s waste management system and prevent the country from becoming a dumping ground. The Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Smriti Manch (PDUSM) campaign played a role in advocating for this decision.&nbsp; &nbsp;India allows PET waste imports&nbsp;The ban on PET bottle imports was lifted in 2021 after industries processing plastic waste reported shortages in India. Seven Indian companies applied to import 93,000 tonnes of PET bottle waste from the US, Canada, and Germany, citing insufficient domestic supply.&nbsp;The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change mandates that beverage makers use 30 per cent recycled plastic in rigid packaging, like PET bottles, starting April 1, 2025 with annual increases of 10 per cent to reach 60 per cent by financial year 2027-28 to 2028-29.&nbsp;Industry urges govt to adopt &lsquo;realistic targets&rsquo;Industry representatives, during a December meeting with the Central Pollution Control Board, argued that the 30 per cent threshold is too stringent due to the scarcity of rPET and urged the government to adopt more realistic targets, suggesting an initial 15 per cent obligation with gradual 5 per cent annual increases, the Hindu Bussinessline had earlier reported.&nbsp;Industry leaders say that despite ongoing investments, recycling capacity expansion takes 2-3 years. At present, only five Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)-approved plants are equipped to produce food-grade rPET, meeting just 15 per cent of industry demand.&nbsp;Affordability and regulatory concernsThe industry fears that bottling costs will surge by nearly 30 per cent, a portion of which may be passed on to consumers. Smaller companies, lacking resources to procure certified rPET, may resort to lower-quality recyclers, raising safety and regulatory concerns.&nbsp;Another challenge is that plastic bottles account for 70 per cent of beverage packaging, making them the most widely used option due to lower transport costs compared to glass and affordability over aluminium cans. The sudden shift to higher rPET content without sufficient infrastructure could disrupt supply chains.&nbsp;Govt response and legal issuesCiting officials, The Economic Times reported that the government is unlikely to extend the deadline, citing that companies have had sufficient time to comply. Industry executives, however, believe the rigid timeline could force them to seek an anticipatory stay in court, delaying implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "title": "Decoded: What is the border tussle between Maharashtra and Karnataka?",
    "body": "The longstanding border dispute between Maharashtra and Karnataka has again flared up following an attack on a bus driver and conductor in Belagavi for allegedly not speaking Marathi. The incident, latest in the decades-old dispute, has led to the bus services between the two states coming to a standstill.&nbsp;The dispute dates back to the linguistic reorganisation of Indian states in 1956 and remains unresolved to date. Here&rsquo;s a closer look.&nbsp;Origins of dispute&nbsp;Following India&rsquo;s independence in 1947, the Belgaum (now Belagavi) district, a region with a multilingual population which was part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, became a focal point of linguistic and territorial disputes. In 1948, the Belgaum municipality requested that the region be merged with Maharashtra, claiming that it had a predominantly Marathi population.&nbsp;To resolve this and other boundary disputes, the States Reorganisation Act was passed in 1956, which redrew state boundaries based on linguistic demographics. Under this act, Belgaum was merged into Karnataka (then Mysore State). The Act included recommendations by the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC), chaired by Justice Fazal Ali, which was established in 1953.&nbsp;The panel, which published its report in 1955, recommended that the Belgaum district, which includes the city of Belgaum and surrounding areas, remain a part of the then Mysore State. This decision was influenced by factors such as administrative convenience, economic links, and the linguistic composition of the region.&nbsp;While the panel acknowledged the presence of both Marathi and Kannada-speaking populations in the border areas, it emphasised that linguistic factors should not be the sole criterion for redrawing state boundaries. The commission considered a combination of administrative efficiency, economic viability, and the wishes of the people in making its recommendations.&nbsp;&ldquo;If as many as nine out of the eleven taluks go to Karnataka (Chandgad going to Bombay and Belgaum being disputed), then, on administrative grounds, the Belgaum town, which is the district headquarters, along with the Belgaum taluk, should also go to Karnataka,&rdquo; the panel noted in its report.&nbsp;However, Maharashtra has long claimed the region, arguing that Marathi-speaking areas, including Belgaum and surrounding villages, should rightfully be part of its territory.&nbsp;Mahajan Commission report&nbsp;To address the dispute, the central government in 1966 established the Mahajan Commission, led by former Chief Justice of India Mehr Chand Mahajan. The commission&rsquo;s report, submitted in 1967, made several key recommendations:&nbsp;1. The commission recommended that Belgaum city and 247 surrounding villages remain within Karnataka.&nbsp;2. It proposed that 264 villages, including areas like Nippani, Khanapur, and Nandagad, be transferred to Maharashtra.&nbsp;Maharashtra rejected the report, terming it &quot;biased and illogical,&quot; while Karnataka welcomed it.&nbsp;Legal and political disputes&nbsp;The dispute took a legal turn in 2004 when Maharashtra filed a petition in the Supreme Court, challenging Karnataka&rsquo;s control over the region. While the case remains pending, the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly passed a unanimous resolution in 2022 asserting its claim over Belagavi and other Marathi-speaking areas in Karnataka.&nbsp;Maharashtra has also lent support to pressure groups such as Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES). In December 2024, Maharashtra objected to the arrest of several MES workers for opposing the Karnataka legislature session in Belagavi.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Karnataka has repeatedly asserted its claim by holding legislative sessions in Belagavi. The state has also dissolved Belagavi City Corporation multiple times for passing resolutions favouring the merger of Belagavi with Maharashtra.&nbsp;In 2022, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde fuelled the dispute by announcing welfare schemes for freedom fighters in Belagavi and other Marathi-speaking regions in Karnataka. In response, then Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai announced grants for Kannada schools in Maharashtra.&nbsp;What is the latest dispute?&nbsp;On February 21, a Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus conductor was allegedly assaulted for not speaking in Marathi in Belagavi&rsquo;s Marihal area. The altercation began when a 17-year-old girl and her companion boarded the bus and demanded the conductor speak Marathi. When he expressed his inability to do so, tensions escalated, leading to the conductor&rsquo;s assault by a gathered crowd. Four people, including the girl, were detained.&nbsp;In response to the assault on the KSRTC conductor, pro-Kannada activists targeted Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses. In Chitradurga, Karnataka, activists halted an MSRTC bus, defaced it, and blackened the driver&rsquo;s face while chanting slogans.&nbsp;Due to these incidents, interstate bus services between Maharashtra and Karnataka remain suspended for the second consecutive day on February 24.",

    "title": "Decoded: Why Tamil Nadu is engaged in a tussle with Centre over NEP",
    "body": "Tamil Nadu has once again opposed the Centre&#39;s National Education Policy (NEP), accusing the BJP-led government of pushing Hindi onto the state. The latest row erupted after the Centre withheld Rs 2,150 crore meant for Tamil Nadu after the MK Stalin-led government refused to implement the NEP in the state.&nbsp;According to Chief Minister MK Stalin, the opposition to the NEP was not merely due to the &quot;attempt to impose Hindi&quot; but also because of factors that would have serious consequences for the future of students and the social justice system.&nbsp;Here&#39;s explaining why Tamil Nadu is opposed to NEP:&nbsp;Core concerns&nbsp;1. Three-language formula: The NEP 2020 recommends a three-language formula, suggesting that students learn three languages, with at least two being native to India. Tamil Nadu has historically adhered to a two-language policy, teaching only Tamil and English in schools. The state perceives the introduction of a third language as an attempt to impose Hindi, which has been a sensitive issue since the anti-Hindi agitations of the 20th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK have expressed strong reservations against this aspect of the NEP, emphasising the importance of preserving Tamil linguistic heritage and opposing any form of Hindi imposition.&nbsp;2. Centralisation and state autonomy: Tamil Nadu argues that the NEP&#39;s framework undermines the state&#39;s autonomy over its educational policies. Education in India is a concurrent subject, allowing both the state and central governments to legislate on it. The state contends that the NEP imposes a uniform national policy that doesn&#39;t account for regional socio-economic and cultural differences, thereby infringing upon the state&#39;s rights to tailor education to its unique context.&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Four-year undergraduate programme: The NEP proposes restructuring undergraduate programmes into a four-year course with multiple exit options, allowing students to leave with a certificate after one year, a diploma after two years, or a degree after completing the full program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics in Tamil Nadu fear that this structure may lead to increased dropout rates, as students might opt for early exit points, thereby affecting the quality and depth of higher education. Also, there are concerns about the state&#39;s readiness in terms of infrastructure and faculty to implement such a system effectively.&nbsp;4. Common entrance exams: Tamil Nadu strongly opposes the entrance exam policies under NEP 2020, particularly CUET and NEET, arguing that they disadvantage state-board students and undermine social justice. The state rejects CUET for university admissions, claiming it favours CBSE students and increases reliance on coaching centres.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did Centre withhold funds for Tamil Nadu?&nbsp;The Centre&#39;s decision to link the release of funds under schemes like Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) to the implementation of the NEP has intensified the controversy. Tamil Nadu alleges that over Rs 2,150 crore in SSA funds have been withheld because of its refusal to adopt the NEP and the three-language policy.&nbsp;According to MK Stalin, the implementation of NEP will push Tamil Nadu back by 2000 years. &quot;The Centre says Tamil Nadu will get Rs 2,000 crore if the state implements the NEP. I wish to say that we will not agree to the NEP even if the Centre offers Rs 10,000 crore. I will not allow the NEP and commit the sin of pushing Tamil Nadu backward by 2,000 years,&quot; Stalin said.&nbsp;Stalin also wrote to PM Modi, asking him to help release Rs 2,152 crore in Samagra Shiksha funds for the state. He requested that the funds not be linked to the implementation of NEP 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Centre&#39;s stand?&nbsp;Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan called out the DMK government&#39;s stand, saying that Stalin&rsquo;s letter to the PM goes against the idea of cooperative federalism.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tamil Nadu has always been a torchbearer of social and educational progress, pioneering some of the most transformative reforms in India. However, the continued opposition to the NEP 2020 for political reasons deprives students, teachers, and educational institutions in Tamil Nadu of the immense opportunities and resources that this policy offers. The policy is designed to be flexible, allowing states to customise its implementation to suit their unique educational needs,&rdquo; Pradhan wrote in response.",

    "title": "Bengaluru metro row explained: Fare hike, protests, and govt blame game",
    "body": "Bengaluru police registered a first information report (FIR) against 16 individuals who participated in a protest against the recent fare hike by the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) and the state government. The protest, organised by members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), took place in front of Kempegowda Metro Station on Friday afternoon, following up to 100 per cent fare hikes of Namma Metro.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s what is known about the fare hike, protests, and resolution.&nbsp;Bengaluru metro hikes fare, removes discountsOn February 9, 2025, BMRCL announced increase in travel fares of Namma Metro, Bengaluru&rsquo;s metro system.The fare adjustments include an increase in the maximum fare to Rs 90 from Rs 60, while the minimum fare for journeys covering the shortest distance (0-2 km) remained unchanged at Rs 10.&nbsp;However, fares for other distances, such as those between 2-4 km and for routes longer than 30 km, had risen by Rs 5-Rs 30. In addition, discounts previously available to QR code users had been removed, with only smart card users receiving a reduced discount of 5 per cent.&nbsp;The minimum balance for smart cards were raised to Rs 90 from Rs 50, while off-peak travel during certain hours offers an additional 5 per cent discount.&nbsp;Why were the metro fares hiked?This fare hike was the first in seven years for the city&rsquo;s metro system. The BMRCL justified the fare revision by citing a report from the fare fixation committee (FFC), which was formed in 2024 by the Union government. The committee, led by a former High Court judge, recommended fare increases based on operational costs, feedback from passengers, and expert consultations.&nbsp;Congress, BJP blame each other for fare hikeThe fare revision, which led to price hikes of up to 100 per cent in some cases, triggered strong reactions from commuters, politicians, and mobility experts. The fare changes also led to heated debates, with political parties accusing each other of responsibility and a public outcry over the impact on daily passengers.&nbsp;The Congress and the Opposition BJP exchanged blame, with both parties accusing the other of influencing the decision for the far hike.&nbsp;BJP leaders, including Basavanagudi MLA Ravi Subramanya, demanded a rollback, while condemning the Congress-led state government for burdening citizens with the fare increase. Meanwhile, the Congress pointed to the BJP-led central government, claiming that the fare hike was a result of recommendations from the central government&rsquo;s fare fixation committee.&nbsp;CM Siddaramaiah calls for rollback on faresFollowing public outcry, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on February 14 directed the BMRCL to reduce fares where the increases were excessive.&nbsp;Siddaramaiah had initially claimed that the state government had no control over the fare revision, as BMRCL operates as a joint venture between the Centre and the State. However, as pressures mounted he called a rollback on certain fares, calling the hike &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo;.&nbsp;On the same day, BMRCL announced a fare revision, capping the maximum hike at 71 per cent and offering reductions for certain routes. The new fare structure, which took effect on February 14, 2025, was intended to address commuter concerns while still adhering to the original recommendations of the fare fixation committee.&nbsp;Protests outside Bengaluru metroDespite the rollback, discontent continued among the public with ABVP organising protests outside the metro stations.&nbsp;The Cottonpet police initiated a suo motu case after receiving complaints regarding the protest.&nbsp;Authorities informed the protesters that the Karnataka High Court&rsquo;s March 3, 2022, order prohibits demonstrations and processions outside Freedom Park. Despite this, the activists allegedly ignored the court&rsquo;s directive and continued their protest. Following the escalation, senior police officers were notified, and additional police forces were deployed from Cottonpet and Upparpet stations.&nbsp;The protesters were subsequently detained. The FIR has been filed under various sections of the Karnataka Police Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including Section 189 (unlawful assembly), Section 190 (holding unlawful assembly members accountable for collective offenses), and Section 223 (disobedience of public orders).&nbsp;[With agency inputs]&nbsp;",

    "title": "US visa interview waiver cut from 48 months to 12 - impact decoded",
    "body": "The United States has reduced the eligibility window for visa interview waivers, commonly known as the dropbox process, from 48 months to 12 months. This change is expected to impact thousands of non-immigrant visa holders, including those on H-1B, F-1, and B1/B2 visas.&nbsp;While the US embassy in India has not confirmed the change, Atlys, an online visa processing platform, said it updated its eligibility criteria in the past week.&nbsp;&quot;Although there hasn&#39;t been any official announcement, the change is now being enforced and applications that have expired for more than 12 months are no longer accepted,&quot; an Atlys spokesperson told Business Standard.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s changed?&nbsp;Previously, individuals could renew their visas using the dropbox system if their previous visa had expired within the past 48 months. This extended policy was introduced during the pandemic to ease consular backlogs. The latest change means many applicants will now have to appear for in-person interviews, which could further strain the visa system.&nbsp;According to The National Law Review, this shift will likely cause delays and travel disruptions for non-immigrant visa holders, including those on:&nbsp;H-1B &ndash; a work visa for skilled professionals in specialised fields, requiring a job offer from a US employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;F-1 &ndash; a student visa for academic programmes in the US, allowing limited on-campus employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;B1/B2 &ndash; a short-term visa for business (B1) or tourism (B2), which does not permit employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;L-1 &ndash; a visa for employees transferring within a multinational company to a US office, applicable to executives, managers, or specialised knowledge workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;O-1 &ndash; a visa for individuals with extraordinary ability in science, arts, education, business, or athletics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has changed?&nbsp;Applicants now qualify for the dropbox process only if their visa expired within the past 12 months and is in the same category. Those who do not meet this requirement must schedule an in-person interview, which may lead to:&nbsp;&lt; Increased demand for in-person appointments at US consulates&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; Longer wait times for visa interviews, particularly in high-volume cities&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; Possible disruptions for business travellers and professionals requiring swift renewals&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; The change is also expected to impact Indian students in the US.&nbsp;Siddharth Iyer, chief operating officer at OneStep Global, told Business Standard, &quot;The recent policy shift in the US visa renewal process for students (F-1) represents a significant adjustment, particularly for applicants in India. With the eligibility for interview waivers now reduced to 12 months from the previous 48 months, some students may experience longer wait times and additional steps when renewing their visas. While this adjustment reflects a return to pre-pandemic regulations, it comes at a time when demand for international education is high.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;This change aims to streamline the process, but it could pose challenges for students who fall outside the updated eligibility window. However, it&#39;s important to note that many students will still have ample opportunities to renew their visas through the regular process,&quot; he said. &quot;Those who are affected by this change should stay informed, plan their renewals well in advance, and continue to reach out to their university&rsquo;s international offices or visa consultants for guidance.&quot;&nbsp;Visa appointment delays in India&nbsp;Getting a visa appointment in India is already a lengthy process. The wait time for a B1/B2 (business and tourism) visa interview in 2022 exceeded 999 days. Though it has since improved, the wait times remain long:&nbsp;Delhi & Mumbai: Over 440 days&nbsp;&nbsp;Chennai: 436 days&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyderabad: 429 days&nbsp;&nbsp;Kolkata: 415 days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the policy change?&nbsp;In response to Business Standard&rsquo;s queries, the US embassy in Delhi said, &quot;The US Department of State is undertaking a full review of all visa programmes as directed under Executive Order 14161. That&rsquo;s all the information we have at this time.&quot;&nbsp;Executive Order 14161, signed by US President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025, is titled &quot;Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats.&quot; The order directs federal agencies to strengthen immigration screening and vetting procedures. It reinstates some policies from the previous Trump administration and requires a review of visa and immigration policies for security risks.&nbsp;It includes:Identifying high-risk countries for potential entry restrictions&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening refugee screening procedures&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluating visa programmes for security vulnerabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancing oversight of foreign nationals already in the US&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementing measures to encourage immigrant assimilation into American society",

The restrictions aim to safeguard depositors&#39; interests and maintain overall financial security.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a circular, the RBI said, &ldquo;...from the close of business on February 13, 2025, the bank shall not, without prior approval of RBI in writing, grant or renew any loans and advances, make any investment, incur any liability including borrowal of funds and acceptance of fresh deposits, disburse or agree to disburse any payment whether in discharge of its liabilities and obligations or otherwise, enter into any compromise or arrangement and sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets.&rdquo;&nbsp;Financial struggles of the bankNew India Co-operative Bank has been grappling with financial difficulties in recent years. Its annual report indicates a loss of Rs 22.78 crore for the financial year ending March 2024, following a previous year&rsquo;s loss of Rs 30.75 crore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the RBI directive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective from the close of business on February 13, 2025, the bank is restricted from:&nbsp;&nbsp;-Issuing or renewing loans and advances&nbsp;&nbsp;-Making fresh investments&nbsp;&nbsp;-Borrowing funds or accepting new deposits&nbsp;&nbsp;-Disbursing payments to meet liabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;-Selling, transferring, or disposing of assets without prior RBI approval&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, depositors will be unable to withdraw funds from their accounts due to the bank&rsquo;s liquidity crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customer concerns and reactionsThe announcement has triggered anxiety among account holders, many of whom depend on the bank for routine financial transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 14, several customers gathered outside the bank&rsquo;s branches in Mumbai, demanding clarity on the situation and access to their funds. Many expressed distress over financial obligations such as loan repayments, rent, and daily expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One customer, Seema Waghmare, told news agency ANI, &ldquo;We deposited money just yesterday, but they did not say anything. They should have told us that this was going to happen. Now they are saying we&rsquo;ll get our money within three months. We have EMIs to pay, and no idea how we&rsquo;ll manage that.&rdquo;&nbsp;Will depositors get their money?&nbsp;&nbsp;The RBI has clarified that while the bank faces financial stress, its licence remains intact, meaning it can still operate under restrictions. The central bank will continue monitoring the situation and decide further action accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under RBI regulations, eligible depositors can receive up to Rs 5 lakh from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) if a claim is made, providing some relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permitted transactions despite restrictionsDespite the imposed limitations, the RBI has allowed the bank to:&nbsp;&nbsp;-Adjust depositors&rsquo; funds against existing loans, subject to conditions&nbsp;&nbsp;-Pay necessary expenses such as employee salaries, rent, and utility bills&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, any new loans, advances, or investments will require prior RBI approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictions will remain in place for six months, during which the RBI will evaluate the bank&rsquo;s financial health and determine the next steps. If improvements are observed, some limitations may be eased; otherwise, further measures could be implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "title": "What are Trump's reciprocal tariffs and which countries will be affected?",
    "body": "US President Donald Trump has signed a new initiative aimed at implementing reciprocal tariffs, a move that could significantly reshape the United States&#39; trade dynamics with the global market.&nbsp;What are reciprocal tariffs?Reciprocal tariffs are measures designed to ensure equitable trade by adjusting tariffs to match those imposed by trading partners. Trump claims that many countries have higher tariffs on US imports than the United States does on theirs, creating an uneven playing field that disadvantages US manufacturing.&nbsp;Regarding reciprocal tariffs, Trump made a campaign promise stating: &ldquo;An eye for an eye, a tariff for a tariff, same exact amount.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Every country will be reciprocal,&rdquo; Trump remarked on Sunday.&nbsp;This idea is not new; during his first term, Trump&#39;s Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, suggested increasing tariffs to align with the import taxes of other nations, with plans to reduce them only once those countries did the same.Trump&rsquo;s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, Howard Lutnick, stated that the proposals could be finalised by early April.However, this approach carries potential risks. Heavier tariffs on imports could lead to increased inflation in the US, the world&rsquo;s largest economy, while also slowing down economic growth in other nations.&nbsp;How will the tariffs be structured?Trump&rsquo;s reciprocal tariffs will be tailored to each trading partner, as reported by Bloomberg, referencing a White House memo. These tariffs aim to address perceived unfair trade practices, including excessive regulations, value-added taxes (VAT), exchange rate manipulation, and inadequate intellectual property protection.&nbsp;The tariffs could be applied in several forms, such as targeting specific products, entire industries, or a general tariff on all goods from a particular country. In some cases, the US might reduce tariffs in response to positive actions from other countries, though this remains uncertain.&nbsp;How did India respond to Trump&rsquo;s tariff call?Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump have agreed to initiate discussions on trade and tariff-related matters, as confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri.&nbsp;During a press briefing following a meeting between PM Modi and Trump at the White House, Misri said, &ldquo;We have indicated, and the two leaders have agreed today to start discussing trade and tariff-related issues.&rdquo;&nbsp;He further added, &ldquo;So, I will let those discussions begin before commenting on what may unfold with regard to the plans announced today by the US administration.&rdquo;&nbsp;Before he met with PM Modi, Trump declared reciprocal tariffs on countries, including India. &ldquo;On trade, I have decided that for fairness, I&rsquo;ll charge reciprocal tariffs &mdash; meaning, whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them &mdash; no more, no less. They charge us with tax and tariffs, it&rsquo;s very simple we will charge them with exact tax and tariffs,&rdquo; Trump explained.&nbsp;Which countries would be most affected by the tariffs?Emerging markets like India, Argentina, and many nations in Africa and Southeast Asia are expected to be hit hardest by these tariffs, according to the report. While these countries will face the most significant impact, other regions will also experience some degree of disruption.&nbsp;[With agency inputs]",

    "title": "President's rule in Manipur? What is it and how it affect state functions",
    "body": "Biren Singh on Sunday stepped down as the Chief Minister of Manipur, a state grappling with ongoing ethnic violence. He submitted his resignation to Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla at the Raj Bhavan. This decision followed escalating tensions and persistent unrest in the northeastern state, which had already claimed hundreds of lives over the past two years.&nbsp;Singh had assumed office as the Chief Minister of Manipur for the first time in 2017.&nbsp;What did Biren Singh&rsquo;s resignation say?&nbsp;In his resignation letter, Biren Singh expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve the people of Manipur and thanked the central government for its timely interventions. &ldquo;It has been an honour to serve the people of Manipur thus far. I am extremely grateful to the central government for timely actions, interventions, developmental work and implementation of various projects for safeguarding the interest of every single Manipuri,&rdquo; he said in his resignation letter.&nbsp;Was Biren Singh losing support among MLAs?News agency PTI reported that Biren Singh had been losing support among BJP MLAs, with several of them meeting party leaders in Delhi to voice their concerns. Despite this, BJP Manipur President A Sharda Devi denied any discord, stating that Biren&#39;s resignation was for the state&#39;s future. She said that his resignation was motivated by a desire for peace and that he had called for the Centre&rsquo;s continued support to ensure the safety of the people.&nbsp;Opposition calls for no-confidence motionOpposition parties had been demanding Singh&rsquo;s resignation for his failure to address the ongoing violence. Following Singh&rsquo;s resignation, Congress&rsquo;s Manipur President Keisham Meghachandra announced plans to move a no-confidence motion in the state Assembly.&nbsp;The Opposition also called for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Manipur to assess the situation. This demand was echoed by Trinamool Congress leader Derek O&rsquo;Brien, who criticised the PM&rsquo;s speech in Parliament for omitting key issues, including the violence in Manipur.&nbsp;Manipur ethnic clashesManipur has been witnessing violent clashes between the valley-based Meitei community and the Kuki-Zo groups. The violence, which began in May 2023, has led to the deaths of over 250 people and displaced thousands. The conflict was sparked by a demand from the Meitei community for Scheduled Tribe status, leading to protests and clashes.&nbsp;Social media videos from the region showed the devastating effects of the violence, including burned homes and disturbing images of sexual harassment. Prominent figures, including boxer MC Mary Kom, have called for peace and security in the state.&nbsp;Biren Singh&rsquo;s role in the ethnic violenceThe controversy surrounding Singh deepened when the Supreme Court sought a forensic report regarding leaked audio clips. These clips allegedly contained conversations suggesting that Singh had allowed Meitei groups to loot arms during the unrest.&nbsp;The Kuki Organisation for Human Rights Trust (KOHUR) called for a court-monitored investigation into the allegations, claiming that Singh played a central role in organising and inciting violence against Kuki-dominated areas.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s next for Manipur state?With Singh&rsquo;s resignation, speculation has risen about the possibility of President&rsquo;s Rule in the state. While the governor has accepted Singh&rsquo;s resignation, he has asked him to continue in office until a successor is appointed.&nbsp;The ruling BJP is expected to hold meetings to finalise a new Chief Minister. The Manipur Assembly&#39;s Budget session, scheduled to begin on February 10, has been suspended until a new leader is in place.&nbsp;President&rsquo;s Rule in Manipur?The imposition of President&rsquo;s Rule in Manipur could be considered under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, which allows the President to take action when a state government fails to comply with constitutional provisions. The decision would follow advice from the Union Council of Ministers.&nbsp;The Article 356 reads, &ldquo;Where any State has failed to comply with, or to give effect to, any directions given in the exercise of the executive power of the Union under any of the provisions of this Constitution, it shall be lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.&rdquo;&nbsp;Several conditions must be met before the President can impose President&#39;s Rule in a state. These include:&nbsp; 1. The President must be convinced that the governance of the state can no longer be carried out in accordance with the Constitution.2. The state government fails to elect a new chief minister within the time frame set by the state&rsquo;s governor.3. A coalition breakdown occurs, resulting in the chief minister losing majority support in the legislature, and the CM is unable to prove majority within the prescribed period.4. The assembly loses its majority due to a no-confidence vote.5. Elections are delayed due to extraordinary circumstances such as natural disasters, war, or an epidemic.&nbsp;What will happen once President&rsquo;s Rule is imposed?Once President&rsquo;s Rule is imposed, the governor assumes the administration of the state on behalf of the President, working with the Chief Secretary and other appointed advisors or administrators. The President can also declare that the powers of the state legislature will be exercised by Parliament.&nbsp;Under this rule, the state legislative assembly may either be suspended or dissolved. Additionally, when Parliament is not in session, the President has the authority to issue ordinances related to the state&#39;s administration.&nbsp;When is the President&rsquo;s Rule revoked?President&rsquo;s Rule can be revoked at any time through a subsequent proclamation by the President. This revocation does not require approval from Parliament. It typically happens when a political party leader presents evidence of majority support in the assembly and claims the right to form the state government.",

    "title": "Delhi Assembly elections 2025: What happens in case of hung assembly?",
    "body": "The 2025 Delhi Assembly elections are shaping up to be a three-way battle between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Congress. With AAP seeking a third consecutive term, the BJP aiming to regain control, and Congress attempting a revival, the contest is expected to be intense.&nbsp;With multiple political parties battling for dominance, there is a possibility that no single party or alliance may secure an absolute majority. In such a case, Delhi could face a hung assembly - a situation where no party has enough seats to form a government on its own.&nbsp;What is a hung assembly?A hung assembly occurs when no political party or alliance wins more than half the seats required to form a government. In Delhi&rsquo;s case, with 70 assembly seats, a party or alliance needs at least 36 seats for a simple majority. If no party reaches this number, the responsibility to form a government falls on the Lieutenant Governor, who follows a specific process:&nbsp;1. Inviting the single-largest party&nbsp;The Lt Governor invites the leader of the party with the most seats to form the government. The party is given around 10 days to prove its majority by securing support from other parties or independent MLAs.&nbsp;ALSO READ:&nbsp;Delhi Assembly election results 2025: Date, time, when and where to watch&nbsp;2. Seeking external support&nbsp;If a party lacks a majority, it can seek external support from other parties without forming a formal alliance. The party offering external support does not usually hold ministerial positions, making the government fragile and vulnerable to collapse.&nbsp;3. Dissolution and re-election&nbsp;If no party can prove a majority within the given timeframe, the Lt Governor dissolves the assembly and calls for fresh elections.&nbsp;What is a minority government?A minority government forms when a party governs despite having fewer than the required majority. In such cases:&nbsp;The ruling party must rely on external parties for legislative support.&nbsp;It struggles to pass laws unless opposition parties abstain or vote in its favour.&nbsp;These governments are unstable and often fail to complete their full term.&nbsp;Delhi elections 2025: Will there be a hung assembly?While most exit polls predicted a BJP victory, the AAP dismissed them, citing past instances where pollsters underestimated its performance. If neither party secures a clear majority, Delhi could face a period of political uncertainty, with negotiations and alliances playing a crucial role in determining the next government.&nbsp;What do the exit polls say?A total of 10 exit polls were released on Wednesday night after polls closed, with seven forecasting a decisive victory for the BJP. The most optimistic projections came from People&#39;s Pulse, Poll Diary, and People&#39;s Insights, predicting BJP could secure anywhere between 40 to 60 seats.&nbsp;Delhi Assembly elections: Most exit polls give BJP clear edge over AAP&nbsp;Axis My India estimated a BJP victory on 45-55 seats. Today&#39;s Chanakya, another major pollster, placed BJP at 51 seats, with AAP trailing at 19. Across the board, Congress was given little to no chance, with most exit polls predicting it would struggle to win even a single seat.&nbsp;Chanakya Strategies, DV Research, JVC, and P-Marq also forecasted BJP as the winner.&nbsp;Exit polls vs reality: Delhi elections 2015, 2020Exit polls have historically struggled to predict AAP&rsquo;s performance in Delhi.&nbsp;2015: Exit polls underestimated AAP&rsquo;s dominance. The average of six major exit polls predicted AAP would win around 45 seats, but the party ended up securing a landslide victory with 67 out of 70 seats. BJP won just three, while Congress was wiped out.&nbsp;2020: Forecasts improved but still fell short of reality. The average of eight exit polls projected AAP would win 54 seats, while BJP was expected to get 15. The final results saw AAP surpass expectations again, winning 62 seats, with BJP managing only eight.&nbsp;Delhi election 2025: How accurate were 2015 and 2020 exit poll predictions&nbsp;With the final results yet to come, the big question remains&mdash;will 2025 see the exit polls get it right, will AAP once again defy predictions, or is there a chance for a hung assembly in the national capital?&nbsp;",

    "title": "Indians entering US via 'Dunki' deported: What is this illegal route?",
    "body": "United States military aircraft, the C-17, recently landed in Amritsar, India, carrying 104 Indian nationals deported for illegal entry into the United States. This marked the first such deportation flight under US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration. As the migrants landed back in India, many shared harrowing details of their journey through the &lsquo;dunki&rsquo; route, a dangerous and illegal method of crossing borders.&nbsp;Among the 104 deported Indians, there were 33 from Haryana, 33 from Gujarat, 30 from Punjab, three from Maharashtra, three from Uttar Pradesh, and two from Chandigarh. The group also included 19 women and 13 minors, with the youngest being a four-year-old boy.&nbsp;Many deportees remained unaware they were being sent back to India until just before departure. Speaking to news agency PTI, Singh, from Hardorwal village in Gurdaspur, recounted being handcuffed and shackled throughout the flight. Restraints were only removed upon arrival in Amritsar.&nbsp;Jaspal, another deportee, said he had paid Rs 30 lakh to an agent who assured him legal entry into the US. Instead, he found himself stranded in Brazil for six months before making the treacherous overland journey to the US, only to be arrested by Border Patrol and held in detention for 11 days.&nbsp;Harwinder Singh, from Hoshiarpur, described 15-hour boat rides, crossing 40-45 km on foot, and surviving near-drownings.&nbsp;The mass deportation signals the Trump administration&rsquo;s intensified crackdown on illegal immigration, particularly through the high-risk &lsquo;donkey route&rsquo; that many Indians continue to take in pursuit of the American dream. Here is a closer look at dunki and understanding what it entails.&nbsp;What is the &lsquo;dunki&rsquo; route?The term &lsquo;dunki&rsquo;, derived from the Punjabi idiom meaning &lsquo;to hop from place to place&rsquo;, refers to an illegal immigration technique known as &lsquo;donkey flights&rsquo;.&nbsp;This method involves crossing borders through a series of covert stops in multiple countries, often facilitated by agents who charge exorbitant fees. These agents may offer a range of services, from providing fake documents to smuggling individuals through ship containers or hidden compartments in vehicles.&nbsp;The process typically begins with migrants obtaining a tourist visa for European Union Schengen countries, allowing them to move freely across 26 nations. Once in the EU, consultants help them illegally enter countries like the UK or the US using forged documents or by hiding in vehicles.&nbsp;While the dunki method can be used to enter any country, the US, Canada, and the UK remain the most sought-after destinations for Indian migrants.&nbsp;Why risk the dunki route?Post-independence, many Indian families who migrated to developed nations found better social, economic, and political conditions, creating a lasting aspiration for others to follow suit. This trend has only intensified over the years, with both legal and illegal migration on the rise.&nbsp;The allure of a better life drives many to take these risks. The promise of higher incomes, greater opportunities, and an improved standard of living, often encapsulated in the idea of the &lsquo;American Dream&rsquo;, fuels the desire to migrate. For many, this dream is worth the dangers and financial sacrifices.In other cases, migrants may be &ldquo;cheated&rdquo; by agents into crossing borders illegally after paying high fees.&nbsp;Some sell ancestral land or other assets to pay agents, only to find themselves exploited further. Agents often withhold passports or demand additional payments, leaving migrants vulnerable and trapped.&nbsp;The dunki route, what it entails, reason why people may embark on it, and what they may find after entering a foreign country was detailed in Raj Kumar Hirani&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dunki&rsquo;, a 2023 Bollywood film starring Shah Rukh Khan, Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal, and Boman Irani.&nbsp;Indians fifth-largest group of US illegal migrantsAccording to the US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP), Indians are the fifth-largest group of illegal migrants entering the US via its southwest border. Between October 2022 and September 2023, nearly 97,000 Indians were caught attempting to cross illegally, with over 30,000 detained at the Canada border and 41,770 at the Mexico border. The majority of these migrants hail from Punjab and Gujarat, states with a long history of migration to Western countries.&nbsp;Risks of illegal migrationThe &lsquo;dunki route&rsquo; is fraught with dangers. Migrants face the risk of capture, imprisonment, and deportation, as was the case in the US. The journey itself is perilous, with harsh weather conditions, rugged terrains, and limited access to food and water.&nbsp;Many also fall victim to exploitation, with agents extorting money or abandoning them mid-journey. While migrant smuggling is distinct from human trafficking, the two crimes can intersect, further endangering those involved. Recent deportation flights also show that these perilous journeys can sometimes amount to nothing.",

    "body": "Imagine taking a single photo and transforming it into a fully animated video, where the subject moves naturally, speaks, and gestures in perfect sync with audio. That&rsquo;s exactly what OmniHuman-1, the latest breakthrough from ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, aims to achieve.&nbsp;&nbsp;This AI framework is designed to generate lifelike human motion and speech from minimal input&mdash;just an image and an audio sample&mdash;solving a key challenge in AI-driven video creation. Previous models struggled with scaling movement data efficiently, often losing valuable motion patterns in the process. OmniHuman-1 advances the field by integrating multiple input sources simultaneously, including images, audio, body poses, and textual descriptions, ensuring more precise and fluid motion synthesis.&nbsp;Trained on 19,000 hrs video footage&nbsp;&nbsp;To build this system, ByteDance researchers trained it on 19,000 hours of video footage, allowing it to smoothly animate still frames into dynamic sequences that feel incredibly real. The AI first compresses movement data from its various inputs and then refines it by comparing its generated videos to real footage.&nbsp;&nbsp;This two-step process enables OmniHuman-1 to produce highly accurate mouth movements, facial expressions, and body gestures, making the final output look natural and immersive. A demonstration of the technology features Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appearing to sing, highlighting both the impressive realism and the potential risks associated with AI-generated deepfakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;OmniHuman-1&nbsp; Generates extremely realistic human videos based on guiding audio, video or a single image. Results are mindblowing, especially the last one ???? pic.twitter.com/s8Lwy6RL8k&mdash; Gradio (@Gradio) February 4, 2025Bring cartoon characters to life &nbsp;Beyond its ability to animate real people, OmniHuman-1 can also bring cartoon characters to life, offering new possibilities in animation, gaming, and digital avatar creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretically, the model can generate videos of unlimited length, with current demonstrations ranging from five to 25 seconds, constrained only by available memory rather than the AI itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;AI-driven media on the rise&nbsp;This development comes shortly after ByteDance introduced INFP, another AI project specialising in animating facial expressions in conversations. Given the massive reach of TikTok and the widespread use of AI-powered tools in ByteDance&rsquo;s video editing app, CapCut, OmniHuman-1 could soon revolutionise how AI-generated media is integrated into mainstream content creation.&nbsp;Future of video AI&nbsp;With ByteDance increasing focus on AI innovation in 2024, OmniHuman-1 represents a major leap forward in AI-driven video generation. As this technology advances, it raises important questions about its implications &mdash; whether for creative storytelling, entertainment, or the growing concerns around deepfakes and digital identity.&nbsp;",

    "title": "Trump bans China's 'de minimis' route: What it is and why it matters",
    "body": "US President Donald Trump&#39;s recent decision to suspend the &#39;de minimis exemption&#39; for Chinese imports has drawn attention to a key mechanism in international trade. The move is part of a broader tariff crackdown aimed at curbing the flow of illicit fentanyl and reining in Chinese e-commerce giants.What is the de minimis route?The de minimis rule exempts low-value imports from customs duties and standard screening procedures. In the US, shipments under $800 qualify for duty-free treatment when sent directly to individual consumers. This is one of the most generous thresholds worldwide; the European Union, for instance, caps its de minimis exemption at &euro;150 ($156).&nbsp;Initially introduced in 1938 to reduce administrative burdens, the de minimis threshold was raised from $200 to $800 during President Barack Obama&#39;s tenure. This change facilitated a surge in small-value imports, particularly from e-commerce platforms.Why did Trump shut down China&#39;s de minimis Route?Trump&rsquo;s administration cited national security concerns as the primary driver behind suspending the de minimis exemption for China, along with Canada and Mexico. The decision was motivated by:&nbsp;1. Curbing fentanyl inflows&nbsp;The United States faces a severe opioid crisis, with fentanyl responsible for nearly 75,000 overdose deaths in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Chinese chemical suppliers have reportedly exploited the de minimis rule to ship fentanyl precursors into the US, often rerouting them through Mexico for illicit drug production. By suspending the exemption, the US aims to enhance screening of incoming shipments and reduce the trafficking of these dangerous chemicals.&nbsp;A Reuters investigation found that de minimis shipments were often subject to less rigorous checks, allowing illegal substances to enter the country undetected.&nbsp;2. Targeting Chinese e-commerce giants&nbsp;Platforms like Shein and PDD Holdings&#39; Temu have benefited from the de minimis route by shipping low-value packages directly from China to US consumers without incurring tariffs. This competitive advantage has put pressure on American retailers. Blocking the de minimis route forces these companies to pay tariffs, levelling the playing field.Impact on trade and e-commerceThe suspension will disrupt supply chains and increase costs for Chinese e-commerce firms, which may pass these expenses on to consumers. However, the scope of the suspension remains limited to China, Canada, and Mexico, leaving other trade partners unaffected.Global de minimis practicesUnited States: $800 thresholdEuropean Union: &euro;150 ($156) thresholdCanada: CAD $20 threshold for non-US shipmentsAustralia: AUD $1,000 threshold&nbsp;The US&rsquo;s high threshold has encouraged massive growth in direct-to-consumer imports, surpassing 1 billion duty-free items in the 2023 financial year, according to Customs and Border Protection data.Key takeaways and potential loopholesTemporary measure: Trump&#39;s executive order does not call for a permanent suspension, meaning de minimis rules could be reinstated in the future.&nbsp;Selective enforcement: Goods from countries other than China, Canada, and Mexico can still enter the US duty-free under de minimis rules.&nbsp;Trade relations: The move is likely to strain US-China trade ties further, as well as affect relations with Canada and Mexico.&nbsp;(With agency inputs)&nbsp;",

    "title": "Chaos erupts as M23 rebels seize Goma: What's happening in DR Congo",
    "body": "The M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo or DRC) has seized control of Goma, a key city in the eastern part of the country, and is now advancing south towards Bukavu. The capture of Goma marks a major escalation in the long-running conflict in the region, which has already displaced more than a million people and led to widespread violence.&nbsp;This has also worsened an already dire humanitarian situation in eastern DRC, with hospitals overwhelmed and bodies left in the streets following the recent escalation. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes to escape the violence.&nbsp;But what led to this conflict? Here&rsquo;s a closer look at the rebel group, their demands, Rwanda&rsquo;s possible role, and UN peacekeeping efforts.&nbsp;Who are the M23 rebels?M23&rsquo;s leadership is dominated by ethnic Tutsis, a minority group in eastern DR Congo. They say they are fighting to protect their people from persecution and attacks by armed Hutu militias, particularly the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). The FDLR includes some Hutus responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which nearly a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.&nbsp;M23, named after the March 23, 2009 peace agreement that ended a previous Tutsi-led uprising, is an armed group dominated by ethnic Tutsis. The agreement promised better political representation and integration of former rebels into the Congolese army. However, M23 claims the government failed to uphold these promises, particularly in integrating Congolese Tutsis into the army and administration, leading them to take up arms again in 2022.&nbsp;Members of the M23 rebel group ride on a pickup truck as they leave their position for patrols amid conflict between them and FARDC, in Goma, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, January 29, 2025 | Photo by Stringer on Reuters&nbsp;What is happening in DRC right now?On Monday night, M23 rebels entered Goma, encountering resistance in key areas, including the airport. By Tuesday evening, the airport had fallen under their control, and hundreds of government soldiers and allied militia had surrendered. By Wednesday morning, M23 had full control of the city, with reports of corpses still visible on the streets, global media houses reported.&nbsp;The leader of the Congo River Alliance (AFC), Corneille Nangaa, which includes M23, told Reuters on Wednesday that the group intends to govern the city. Meanwhile, rebel forces have started advancing south from Minova, a town on Lake Kivu&rsquo;s western shore, toward Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province.&nbsp;Goma: Gateway to DRC&rsquo;s rich mineralsGoma is not just any city &ndash; it is a strategic hub located on the border with Rwanda and on the shores of Lake Kivu. The city is a gateway to rich mining areas that produce valuable resources like gold, tin, and coltan &ndash; a key mineral used in mobile phones and batteries for electric vehicles.&nbsp;Controlling Goma gives M23 access to trade routes and economic power.&nbsp;M23 has been a dominant force in the region for more than a year, controlling the coltan-mining area of Rubaya. The group generates around $800,000 per month through a production tax on coltan, a mineral crucial for manufacturing smartphones and electronic devices, Reuters said.&nbsp;Conflict ongoing for more than 30 yearsThe conflict in eastern DR Congo is not new and has been ongoing for more than 30 years, since the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. The region is home to over 100 armed groups, all fighting for power, ethnic dominance, and control over DR Congo&rsquo;s vast mineral wealth.&nbsp;Rwanda and Uganda have a history of military interventions in DR Congo, dating back to 1996 and 1998, when both countries invaded, saying they were targeting Hutu militias. These conflicts turned into two devastating wars, often called &quot;Africa&rsquo;s World Wars,&quot; that killed millions of people.&nbsp;Is Rwanda involved in the conflict?The Congolese government, UN officials, and Western nations, including the US, have accused Rwanda of backing M23 by supplying troops and weapons. A 2022 UN report claimed to have &ldquo;solid evidence&rdquo; of Rwandan soldiers fighting alongside the rebels.&nbsp;Rwanda denies these allegations, arguing that its actions are defensive. It also accuses the DRC of collaborating with the FDLR, which has carried out attacks on Tutsi communities in both Congo and Rwanda.&nbsp;Global implications of conflictThe conflict in DR Congo is more than a regional issue and can have severe global implications. The country is one of the world&rsquo;s largest sources of coltan, gold, and other minerals used in everyday electronics. The ongoing fighting disrupts supply chains and could lead to rising prices for tech products.&nbsp;International response to DRC conflictUN peacekeepers, deployed under the MONUSCO mission, had been assisting the Congolese army in containing M23. However, the planned withdrawal of MONUSCO has been put on hold due to the worsening security situation. Around 11,000 peacekeepers remain in eastern Congo, according to a report by BBC.&nbsp;Following the fall of Goma, UN forces evacuated staff and their families, while many government officials and pro-government militia members sought refuge at UN bases. The Congolese military had also hired private military contractors, including Romanian mercenaries, to combat M23. Many of these contractors have since surrendered and left the country.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Southern African Development Community extended its military mission in DRC last year to assist the Congolese army. However, both Congolese and regional forces have suffered losses in the recent fighting.&nbsp;Countries like the United States and France have urged Rwanda to stop supporting M23. With M23 now in control of Goma, the next phase of the conflict will likely determine whether they can hold onto the city or expand further. If they move towards Bukavu, it could deepen the crisis.&nbsp;",

    "title": "PM Modi compares Arvind Kejriwal to serial killer: Who is Charles Sobhraj?",
    "body": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has once again compared Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to Charles Sobhraj, the notorious serial killer and conman, in the lead-up to the Delhi Assembly elections. Addressing a rally in Kartar Nagar on Wednesday, Modi accused Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders of misleading the public and likened them to Sobhraj, infamous for his ability to deceive people.&nbsp;&ldquo;Those who built sheesh mahal and looted public money worth thousands of crores can never think of the welfare of the poor. That is why they are spreading lies in Delhi. These AAP-da people lie so convincingly that people fall for them,&rdquo; Modi said.&nbsp;&ldquo;You may have heard of Charles Sobhraj. He was a known thug, but he was such an expert at deceiving people with innocence that they kept getting fooled by him. That is why one has to remain cautious of such people,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;Who is Charles Sobhraj?Charles Gurmukh Sobhraj is a French serial killer, fraudster, and thief who gained notoriety for targeting Western tourists on the &ldquo;hippie trail&rdquo; across South Asia in the 1970s. Dubbed &ldquo;The Serpent&rdquo; for his ability to assume multiple identities and evade capture, he was also called the &ldquo;Bikini Killer&rdquo; as several of his victims were young women found murdered in swimwear.&nbsp;Murders and modus operandiSobhraj has been linked to over 20 murders between 1972 and 1982. His crimes followed a pattern&mdash;he would befriend tourists, gain their trust, then drug, rob, and ultimately kill them, often through strangulation, burning, or beating. Using stolen passports, he travelled freely across borders, making it difficult for authorities to track him.&nbsp;Criminal beginningsBorn in 1944 in what is now Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to an Indian father and a Vietnamese mother, Sobhraj had a troubled childhood. He later acquired French citizenship through his mother, as Vietnam was a French colony at the time.&nbsp;As a teenager, he started committing petty crimes and received his first prison sentence for burglary in 1963 in France. While serving time at Poissy prison, he manipulated officials into granting him special privileges&mdash;foreshadowing his future ability to deceive people.&nbsp;After his release, Sobhraj entered Parisian high society while simultaneously engaging in burglaries and scams. In 1970, he fled France to escape arrest, travelling through Eastern Europe using fake documents and robbing tourists. He eventually reached Mumbai, where he set up a car theft and smuggling operation.&nbsp;Crimes in IndiaSobhraj&rsquo;s criminal activities escalated in India, Nepal, and Thailand, where he became infamous for drugging, robbing, and murdering travellers.&nbsp;In 1973, he was arrested in Delhi for an attempted armed robbery at a jeweller&rsquo;s shop at The Ashok Hotel. He faked an illness to escape but was recaptured. He later fled to Kabul, where he resumed robbing tourists before escaping again by drugging a hospital guard.&nbsp;By 1975, he had formed a criminal network, including his Canadian girlfriend Marie-Andr&eacute;e Leclerc and Indian associate Ajay Chowdhury. Together, they targeted Western backpackers in Thailand and Nepal.&nbsp;Interpol issued an international arrest warrant against Sobhraj in 1976, linking him to four murders in Thailand. He was arrested in India the same year after a group of French post-graduate students caught on to his scam.&nbsp;Escape from Tihar JailHis notoriety grew after his dramatic escape from Delhi&rsquo;s Tihar Jail in 1986. Along with six other inmates, he drugged prison officials by offering them spiked sweets before escaping in a waiting car. He was recaptured nearly a month later in Goa and sentenced to 10 more years in prison.&nbsp;Imprisonment in NepalAfter his release from Tihar, Sobhraj was arrested in Nepal, where he was convicted of the 1975 murders of American tourist Connie Jo Bronzich and her Canadian friend Laurent Carriere. He was sentenced to two consecutive 20-year prison terms. He remained incarcerated in Nepal until 2022 when, citing his age and good behaviour, a Nepalese court ordered his release.&nbsp;Following his release, he was deported to France and banned from re-entering Nepal for at least 10 years.&nbsp;Charles Sobhraj in pop cultureSobhraj&rsquo;s life and crimes have inspired several adaptations. In 2021, BBC and Netflix released The Serpent, a drama series based on his story. More recently, Netflix released Black Warrant in January 2025, directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, which explores his time in Tihar Jail during the 1980s. Actor Sidhant Gupta portrays Sobhraj in this adaptation.&nbsp;Modi&rsquo;s comparison of Kejriwal to SobhrajModi&rsquo;s reference to Sobhraj in his attack on Kejriwal follows a pattern of the Prime Minister using strong rhetoric against political opponents. He accused AAP leaders of deception, claiming they misled the public with false promises, just as Sobhraj tricked his victims.&nbsp;The Delhi Assembly elections are scheduled for February 5, with vote counting set for February 8.&nbsp;Kejriwal and AAP are yet to respond to Modi&rsquo;s remarks comparing them to the infamous serial killer.&nbsp;",

    "title": "What is DeepSeek: China's open-source AI research lab which rivals OpenAI",
    "body": "Chinese AI research lab DeepSeek grabbed global attention last week with the release of its open-source AI model, DeepSeek-R1. The company says the model rivals industry giants like OpenAI in critical areas such as mathematical reasoning, code generation, and cost efficiency, signalling a shift in the global AI landscape.&nbsp;What is Deepseek?DeepSeek is an artificial intelligence research lab which emerged from Fire-Flyer, a deep-learning branch of High-Flyer, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund. Established in 2015, High-Flyer gained prominence by leveraging advanced computing to analyse financial data. By 2023, its founder, Liang Wenfeng, redirected resources towards creating DeepSeek, aspiring to develop groundbreaking AI models.&nbsp;Unlike most Chinese AI firms, DeepSeek operates independently of major tech giants such as Baidu and Alibaba. Liang&rsquo;s motivation for this ambitious venture was rooted in scientific curiosity rather than immediate financial returns. &ldquo;Basic science research rarely offers high returns on investment,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp;What is DeepSeek-R1?DeepSeek-R1 is an advanced reasoning model that claims to surpass existing benchmarks on several critical tasks. The model and its variants, such as DeepSeek-R1-Zero, employ large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) techniques and multi-stage training to achieve their capabilities.&nbsp;DeepSeek has also taken a notable step by open-sourcing not just its flagship models but also six smaller distilled variants, ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters. These models are MIT-licensed, enabling researchers and developers to freely distil, fine-tune, and commercialise their work.&nbsp;DeepSeek vs OpenAI: Is there a difference?Both Open AI and Deepseek have leveraged AI to create their own large language models (LLM). However, unlike traditional models that depend on supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek-R1-Zero claims to have emerged with robust reasoning abilities after training solely with RL. However, to enhance readability and address language inconsistencies, DeepSeek introduced DeepSeek-R1, which matches OpenAI&rsquo;s o1 model in performance on reasoning tasks.&nbsp;DeepSeek also advanced technical designs such as multi-head latent attention (MLA) and a mixture of experts, which made its models more cost-effective. The latest DeepSeek model required just one-tenth of the computing power used by Meta&rsquo;s comparable Llama 3.1 model, according to a report by Epoch AI.&nbsp;Who are the people behind Deepseek?Liang Wenfeng, born in 1985, is a Chinese entrepreneur and the founder and CEO of DeepSeek. He is also the co-founder of the quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang&#39;s educational background includes a Bachelor of Engineering in electronic information engineering and a Master of Engineering in information and communication engineering from Zhejiang University.&nbsp;In 2016, he co-founded the quantitative investment firm Ningbo High-Flyer, which utilised mathematics and AI for investment strategies. Liang expanded his focus on AI by founding High-Flyer AI in 2019, which specialised in AI algorithms and applications. Through DeepSeek, Liang has positioned himself at the forefront of AI research.&nbsp;Young talents driving AI leadership at DeepSeekDeepSeek&rsquo;s workforce is composed of fresh graduates from prestigious Chinese universities like Peking University and Tsinghua University, Founder Liang told Chinese publication 36Kr in 2023. Despite their lack of industry experience, these researchers bring a wealth of academic expertise and a collaborative mindset, which Liang considers ideal for tackling high-investment, low-profit challenges.&nbsp;Young researchers at DeepSeek view their work as a way to overcome global technological barriers and elevate China&rsquo;s status as a leader in innovation, Liang said.&nbsp;Overcoming US chip restrictions with DeepSeekDeepSeek&rsquo;s accomplishment is particularly noteworthy given the constraints posed by the ongoing tech competition between the US and China.&nbsp;In October 2022, the US government imposed export controls aimed at limiting Chinese AI firms&rsquo; access to advanced computing hardware, including Nvidia&rsquo;s H100 chips. While DeepSeek began with a stockpile of 10,000 H100s, it quickly became apparent that more would be needed to compete with global leaders such as OpenAI and Meta.&nbsp;DeepSeek&rsquo;s Founder Liang explained in a 2023 interview with 36Kr, &ldquo;The problem we are facing has never been funding, but the export control on advanced chips.&rdquo;&nbsp;With limited access to advanced chips due to export restrictions, Chinese tech firms have often prioritised application-focused development rather than foundational AI research. DeepSeek, however, defied this trend by rethinking AI&rsquo;s underlying architecture and optimising resource efficiency, as pointed out by a report by the Wired.&nbsp;Efficient strategies powering DeepSeek&rsquo;s AIHighlighting the significance of this, a tech industry analyst told the Wired, &ldquo;DeepSeek represents a new wave of Chinese companies focused on long-term innovation over short-term gains.&rdquo;&nbsp;To overcome the limitations, DeepSeek adopted a range of efficiency-focused strategies to refine its model architecture. By incorporating engineering techniques, the company managed to reduce resource requirements without compromising performance. These innovations included:Custom communication schemes: Improved data exchange between chips to save memory.Memory optimisation: Reduced field sizes to maximise efficiency.Mix-of-models approach: A unique way of combining smaller models to achieve superior results.&nbsp;DeepSeek&rsquo;s global impact on AI researchBy open-sourcing its models under an MIT licence and sharing its breakthroughs, DeepSeek has gained significant recognition within the global AI research community. By providing access to model weights and outputs, the company aims to empower developers worldwide to build on its technology. This move not only democratises access to cutting-edge AI tools but also challenges the dominance of Western firms in the artificial intelligence space.&nbsp;",

Additionally, the expiry of Nifty monthly, quarterly, and half-yearly contracts was set to change from the last Thursday of the expiry month to the last Monday.However, in light of Sebi&#39;s consultation paper, the exchange decided to delay the implementation of this change until further notice.&quot;Members are required to note that the implementation of this circular is deferred until further notice in view of Sebi consultation paper dated March 27, 2025 on final settlement day (expiry day) for equity derivatives,&quot; NSE said in a circular issued late night on Thursday.In its consultation paper issued on Thursday, Sebi proposed that the expiries of all equity derivatives contracts across exchanges be uniformly limited to either Tuesdays or Thursdays.This would help optimise the spacing between expiries and avoid designating either the first or last day of the week as the expiry day.Furthermore, the regulator recommended that exchanges should seek Sebi&#39;s approval before launching or modifying any contract expiry or settlement day.&quot;Every exchange will continue to be allowed one weekly benchmark index options contract, on their chosen day (Tuesday or Thursday),&quot; the regulator proposed.The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) invited public comments on these proposals until April 17.Derivative in financial markets typically refers to a forward, future, option or any other hybrid contract of pre-determined fixed duration, linked for the purpose of contract fulfilment to the value of a specified real or financial asset or to an index of securities.Broadly, there are two types of derivative contracts -- futures and options. A futures contract means a legally binding agreement to buy or sell the underlying security on a future date, while options contract gives the buyer or holder of the contract the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price within or at end of a specified period.",

    "title": "Body of 4th cop sighted as security forces resume operation in J&K's Kathua",
    "body": "The body of another policeman was sighted using a drone on Friday near the spot where a gunfight took place earlier in a remote forested area in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said.This is the fourth cop to be have died in the gunfight in which three terrorists are also confirmed to have been killed, officials said.Heavy firing and deafening sounds of explosions continued for the second day as police assisted by the Army and CRPF moved this morning from different directions, after a night halt to sanitise the Safiyan area, they said.On Thursday, three suspected Pakistani terrorists of proscribed Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) outfit and an equal number of policemen were found dead after the day-long gunfight while one policeman was reported missing. Seven others, including a deputy superintendent of police, were injured in the gunbattle.The officials said the security forces resumed the operation with the first light of the day, having the primary focus to retrieve the bodies of the deceased, finding a missing policeman and neutralising any other threat.They said the joint security parties are moving cautiously to the targeted area as two more terrorists are believed holed up there. They were also presumed dead earlier but their bodies could not be sighted by the drones.The operation, centred near Jakhole village in the Ghati Juthana area of Rajbagh, against the terrorists started around 8 am on Thursday amid intensified operations led by police against the ultras who had recently infiltrated from across the International Border in Hiranagar sector, the officials said.However, it was not immediately clear whether it was the same group that had been evading an earlier cordon in Sanyal forest of Hiranagar or another batch of infiltrated terrorists.Three terrorists were killed in the onslaught led by the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Jammu and Kashmir Police and assisted by the Army and CRPF.Adding to the tension, five police personnel, including a Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO), were reportedly trapped near the gunfight&#39;s location, adjacent to a rivulet concealed by dense foliage.However, the SDPO -- a DSP rank officer -- was evacuated in an injured condition from the scene late Thursday evening, while three of his personal security officers were found dead while another body of a policeman was sighted this morning.Besides the SDPO, three more policemen were admitted to Kathua hospital and their condition was stated to be stable . Two army personnel were also injured in the operation.Earlier, a group of terrorists was intercepted on Sunday evening within a &#39;dhok&#39;, a local term for an enclosure in a nursery, in Sanyal village near the International Border with Pakistan in the Hiranagar sector.A subsequent search operation, involving the police, army, NSG, BSF and CRPF, utilised advanced technical and surveillance equipment to track down and neutralize the terrorists.Despite the massive search operation, the terrorists managed to escape the initial cordon, the officials said, adding it is assumed that the same group could have been possibly spotted near Jakhole, approximately 30 km from the initial encounter site.The search teams discovered evidence on Monday, including four loaded magazines of M4 carbine, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, tracksuits, food packets, and materials for constructing improvised explosive devices (IEDs) near the Hiranagar encounter site.The terrorists were moving through the forest area towards the Billawar side when a police party headed by a SDPO moved in after getting specific information but came under heavy firing, resulting in the day-long gunfight.Reinforcements from the police, army, and CRPF were immediately deployed to the area, while the special forces of the army were also airdropped to neutralise the terrorists.Police believe the terrorists infiltrated on Saturday, possibly via a ravine route or a newly constructed tunnel from across the border.Director General of Police, Nalin Prabhat and Inspector General of Police (Jammu Zone) Bhim Sen Tuti have been overseeing the anti-terrorist operation from Kathua for the past four days, the officials said.The People&#39;s Anti-Fascist Front, a proxy outfit of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), claimed responsibility for the encounter.Army&#39;s rising star corps, whose troops are involved in the operation, lauded the police personnel involved in the operation.Rising Star Corps salutes the valor & indomitable spirit of the brave (J&K) Police personnel who made the supreme sacrifice fighting valiantly during the ongoing OP (operation) Safiyan in Kathua. Their courage and dedication will always be remembered, the Army said in a post on X.",

Diplomats from various countries also joined the gathering. pic.twitter.com/hR0LEmqL4z&mdash; ANI (@ANI) March 27, 2025The gathering reinforced India&#39;s long-standing ties with the Islamic world, with diplomats acknowledging PM Modi&#39;s role in fostering strategic, economic, and cultural partnerships with Muslim nations.The event was attended by ambassadors and diplomats from Somalia, Morocco, Afghanistan, Syria, Gambia, Mali, Bangladesh, Sudan, Djibouti, Algeria, Malawi, Cameroon, Chad, Guinea, Iraq, Cote d&#39;Ivoire, Tanzania, Nigeria, Iran, and the UAE. Also present were Islamic scholars, religious leaders, intellectuals, and social reformers, including Majid Alnekhailawi, Maulana Syed Kalbe Rushaid Rizvi, Haji Syed Salman Chishty, and IMF co-founder Himani Sood.Before breaking their fast, attendees offered prayers for peace, harmony, and prosperity in India and across the world. Addressing the gathering, ambassadors from Muslim-majority nations highlighted India&#39;s strong ties with the Islamic world. They noted India&#39;s growing engagement with South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East, particularly in strengthening security and economic cooperation.&quot;India&#39;s engagement with the Gulf region, which supplies over 60 per cent of its crude oil, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) nations, with which bilateral trade exceeds USD 200 billion, has become more robust and multifaceted under PM Modi&#39;s leadership in the past 10 years,&quot; they stated. They further acknowledged India&#39;s increasing diplomatic presence in global affairs, with PM Modi receiving the highest civilian honours from several Muslim-majority countries.The ambassadors highlighted India&#39;s consistent stance in promoting peace and stability in global conflicts involving Muslim nations. They noted that &quot;India has long positioned itself as a strong advocate for peace, stability, and dialogue in global conflicts involving the Muslim world, from Palestine to Afghanistan.&quot;They emphasised India&#39;s support for a two-state solution for Palestine and humanitarian aid to Gaza. They also commended India&#39;s role in Afghanistan, stating, &quot;India has played a constructive role by investing in critical infrastructure, education, and healthcare to improve the lives of the Afghan people.&quot;The ambassadors pointed out that India has never engaged in military aggression against any Muslim-majority country and has upheld diplomacy as a guiding principle in its foreign policy.Rajya Sabha MP Satnam Singh Sandhu underscored India&#39;s tradition of coexistence and inclusivity, stating, &quot;Ramzan is not just a religious observance; it is a time for reflection, generosity, and community bonding--a sentiment that India deeply values and upholds. India has always been a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, and multi-religious society, where every faith has co-existed in harmony for ages. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has further strengthened this spirit of oneness and brotherhood amongst Indians over the past decade by ensuring the progress of every community irrespective of any discrimination through his &#39;Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas&#39; mantra, reflecting India&#39;s inclusive ethos.&quot;Ambassadors also spoke about India&#39;s growing role in the Global South and its contributions to developing nations.Edson Moyo, Minister Plenipotentiary of Zimbabwe, praised India&#39;s technological advancements and its impact on global development. &quot;India and Zimbabwe share strong bilateral ties. India has always stood by Zimbabwe. We have focused on economic diplomacy and continued to move together. Artificial intelligence is one new area where India is moving forward rapidly. India has become the fastest developing country in the world. India can help in technology transfer.&quot;He added, &quot;We have a lot to learn from the social sector and particularly the IT sector in India. India&#39;s role as a technology transfer hub is very important. We are very excited to learn about the UPI payment system in India; it indeed is a great experience to pay by UPI. You don&#39;t have to carry cash; everything is done electronically. We are also working to introduce a UPI-like system in our country. We are looking to establish more collaborations with India.&quot;High Commissioner of Gambia to India, Mustapha Jawara, credited India&#39;s leadership in global peace efforts and its role in international diplomacy.&quot;During Covid, India donated Gambia lots of vaccines, and that saved so many lives. We are grateful to the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) and his government for that.&quot;He further said, &quot;He (PM Modi) is the leader of the Global South. I will say that the Prime Minister (Modi) is the best of the best. In the Global South, we love him. He is a global leader. He has shown this during the G20, and we in the Global South are proud of him for his role. It&#39;s because of him, our Continent, Africa, has a representation in the G20. So we are grateful for that. He is championing our rights at all levels. So we have nothing but to thank him.&quot;On India&#39;s commitment to peaceful coexistence, he remarked, &quot;India is an example as the second-largest Muslim country as far as I know. Me as a Muslim, has been invited to a function by a non-Muslim. That is a testament to that.&quot;He also praised India&#39;s diplomatic efforts, stating, &quot;Because of India, there is peace in the world. If it were not India and the Prime Minister (Modi), the issue between Russia and Ukraine would have gone to another level.&quot;Sudan&#39;s Education Counsellor, Mohamed Ali Fazari, said, &quot;India is championing the cause of the Global South along with other developing and developed countries. India is a leading country in the world in terms of helping many other nations across the world. The relationship between India and African nations has strengthened over the years. We have seen how India helped many countries during the Covid-19 pandemic.&quot;Cultural Counsellor of Iran, Fariduddin Faridasr, emphasised the cultural and historical ties between India and Iran. He said, &quot;What is common between India and Iran is that Prime Ministers of both the nations are connected to their soil, rooted in their culture, heritage and value system. India and Iran shared strong bilateral ties in the past and they will continue to strengthen it further in future as well. Due to these shared beliefs of PMs of both the nations, bilateral relations between India and Iran will be strengthened further. Supremacy of law is the soul of secularism, and India has that unique power of secularism which is one amongst the many reasons that India will progress further as it gives respect and love to people from all communities equally.&quot;A representative from Iraq attending the event also echoed the sentiment that India remains committed to inclusive development. Iraq&#39;s representative said, &quot;India is a multi-cultural, multi-religion and multi-community nation, but under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the whole country is united to work for one cause of Viksit Bharat. The relationship between India and Iraq is growing in all the fields. The minority communities have been looked after with care and affection in India.",

She is a disgrace to West Bengal. The Hindu Bengali diaspora wants her out as the Chief Minister for destroying Bengal&#39;s legacy and putting them through such ignominy,&quot; he added.The Video posted by the BJP showed the West Bengal CM facing several interruptions during which someone in the audience raised a question about the Hindus in Bengal.&quot;I am for all, Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians,&quot; Banerjee responded, which was followed by &quot;Go back&quot; slogans from a section of the audience.The Chief Minister addressed one of the protesters as &quot;brother&quot; and said, &quot;Please remember this... and don&#39;t do politics. It&#39;s very easy to do politics here and create negative narratives.&quot;In a video from the interaction posted by the Trinamool Congress, the Chief Minister then responded to the protestors saying, &quot;You encourage me, Please smile with a hope that Didi will come every time, Didi don&#39;t get bothered, Didi don&#39;t bother anybody, Didi walk just like a Royal Bengal Tiger and if you can catch me me.&quot;Posting the video, Trinamool Congress said, &quot;She (Mamata Banerjee) doesn&#39;t flinch.

Instead of allowing us to peacefully express our opinions, the police were called...In support of the students and working masses of West Bengal, SFI-UK raised its voice in opposition to Mamata Banerjee and the TMC&#39;s corrupt, undemocratic rule.&quot;BJP leader Amit Malviya also posted another video from the interaction in which Mamata Banerjee was seen engaged a conversation on &#39;Social Development - Girl, Child and Women Empowerment in West Bengal&#39; at Kellogg College, University of Oxford, during which she disagreed with the claim that India will become the world&#39;s first economy by 2060.&quot;India has already overtaken the UK; we are now the 6th largest economy, and India is the fifth largest economy. Soon, it will be the third largest economy in the world. By 2060, it is predicted that it will be the first economy in the world,&quot; the host of the discussion remarked, to which Mamata Banerjee said, &quot;I will differ that.&quot;In his post Amit Malviya said that the West Bengal Chief Minister has a problem with India becoming the world&#39;s largest economy.&quot;West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has a problem with India becoming the world&#39;s largest economy...

The deal is set to value the company at $300 billion including dollars raised &mdash; almost double the ChatGPT maker&rsquo;s previous valuation of $157 billion from when it raised money in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the deal, SoftBank will invest an initial $7.5 billion in the company, along with $2.5 billion from an investor syndicate, said one of the people familiar with the discussions. There will be a second tranche of $30 billion later this year that will include $22.5 billion from SoftBank, and $7.5 billion from a syndicate, this person said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its shares slid as much as 4.7 per cent in Tokyo. The company&rsquo;s credit default swaps widened, in part because of concerns about the impact of such a large outlay on its finances.&nbsp;SoftBank declined to comment.

    "body": "The valuation of Jaiprakash Associates&rsquo; assets has taken a hit after the Allahabad High Court recently upheld an order by a government agency to cancel 1,000 hectares (approximately 2,471 acres) of land allotted to the company for its sports city project near New Delhi years before it went bankrupt.&nbsp;The cancellation by Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) was a setback for the real estate company, which this week drew expressions of interest from around 24 suitors, including Jindal Power, Adani, Suraksha, and Torrent Group. &ldquo;We are reviewing the order, as it will directly impact the company&rsquo;s valuation when financial bids are invited,&rdquo; said the representative of a company that bid for Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL).&nbsp;JAL was admitted into the insolvency process on June 3. Total claims filed against it in insolvency proceedings amount to Rs 64,552 crore, according to the court order. Of that amount, claims worth Rs 51,512 crore were admitted by insolvency authorities.&nbsp;JAL owns cement manufacturing units of 10 million tonnes annual capacity and power, road, fertiliser, and tunnel projects. The company employs 19,154 people and reported total assets of Rs 36,140 crore and revenue of Rs 6,568 crore as of March 2024, according to its website.&nbsp;The insolvency professional will provide bidders access to data on JAL and final bids would be invited. The land was allotted in 2008 for mixed-use development, including sports infrastructure, residential, and commercial spaces. YEIDA cancelled the allotment after the company did not pay dues and failed to develop core sports facilities within deadline. Despite JAL&rsquo;s argument for partial cancellation, the High Court on March 10 upheld full cancellation of the allotment.&nbsp;A group of lenders comprising State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank, Axis Bank, LIC, and others on March 11 transferred the unpaid loans and related financial assets of Jaiprakash Associates to National Asset Reconstruction Ltd This transfer includes securities, pledged shares, guarantees, and receivables that were used as collateral for loans.&nbsp;The company&#39;s real estate holdings near the upcoming Jewar International Airport have drawn interest from potential buyers, offering access to a diverse population across different socio-economic groups. It also owns hotels in the NCR, benefiting from high occupancy rates due to their strategic locations in Delhi, near Basant Lok Complex and the airport. Beyond real estate, the company operates cement units with captive power plants, leveraging well-positioned limestone reserves in key cement-consumption states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to drive efficiency and growth. Additionally, as a leader in the hydropower and construction sectors, the company provides a platform for expansion, supported by a proven history of profitability, the company said in a presentation to bidders.&nbsp;Taking stock&nbsp;The Allahabad High Court recently upheld an order to cancel 1K hectares of land allotted to Jaiprakash Associates&nbsp;&nbsp;The land was for the real estate company&rsquo;s sports city project near New Delhi&nbsp;&nbsp;JAL was admitted into the insolvency process on June 3&nbsp;Total claims filed against it in insolvency proceedings amount to Rs 64,552 cr&nbsp;The insolvency professional will provide bidders access to data on JAL and final bids would be invited&nbsp;",

    "title": "Insider trading glare on senior IndusInd Bank officials. What do rules say?",
    "body": "Senior officials at IndusInd Bank are under regulatory scrutiny for potential violations of insider trading regulations. According to a report in The Economic Times, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is examining whether five senior executives of the private sector lender were in possession of unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI) while selling shares of the company in the open market. The report stated that Sebi has sought details of trades executed by the senior officials.&nbsp;According to stock exchange disclosures, between May 2023 and June 2024, IndusInd Bank Chief Executive Officer Sumant Kathpalia sold nearly 950,000 shares valued at approximately Rs 134 crore, while Deputy Chief Executive Officer Arun Khurana sold 550,000 shares worth around Rs 82 crore. These shares were part of their employee stock option plans.&nbsp;The transactions have come under scrutiny as IndusInd shares have declined over 30 per cent due to losses incurred by the lender from its derivatives exposure.&nbsp;Could the share sales land IndusInd officials in trouble?&nbsp;&ldquo;If a top official has traded in shares while in possession of UPSI, it could potentially amount to a violation of Sebi&rsquo;s insider trading norms, unless the transactions fall under specific exceptions permitted by the regulations,&rdquo; said Supreme Waskar, a corporate lawyer based in Mumbai.&nbsp;However, the law provides certain exemptions.&nbsp;&ldquo;These include off-market inter-se transfers between insiders, trades executed pursuant to a pre-approved trading plan, or transactions carried out to comply with statutory or regulatory obligations. If the trades do not meet the criteria for these exceptions, it would constitute a breach of insider trading norms,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;Under Sebi regulations, insiders must disclose any change in shareholding if the transaction value exceeds Rs 10 lakh. The company also has an obligation to ensure the trading window remains closed during periods when insiders are reasonably expected to have access to UPSI. Failure to comply with these disclosure and compliance norms can also result in regulatory action.&nbsp;What are the penalties for insider trading?&nbsp;&ldquo;If an insider trades in securities while in possession of UPSI, Sebi can impose monetary penalties starting from Rs 10 lakh, which can go up to Rs 25 crore or three times the profit made from such trades, whichever is higher,&rdquo; said Waskar.&nbsp;In cases involving non-disclosure of shareholding changes as mandated under Sebi regulations, the penalty ranges from a minimum of Rs 1 lakh to a maximum of Rs 1 crore.&nbsp;&ldquo;Additionally, under Section 24 of the Sebi Act, the regulator can initiate criminal proceedings, which may lead to imprisonment for up to 10 years, a fine of up to Rs 25 crore, or both,&rdquo; Waskar said.&nbsp;However, criminal convictions for insider trading remain rare in India compared to jurisdictions such as the United States.&nbsp;",

    "title": "Cognizant looks to break into top four IT services companies by 2027",
    "body": "Cognizant has said it aims to be back among India&rsquo;s top four IT services companies by 2027 by improving revenue, market share, bagging large deals, and gradual margin expansion.&nbsp;The Nasdaq-listed company does a major part of its business in India, but has trailed peers such as Tata Consultancy Services and Accenture over the last few years as growth tapered, margins squeezed, and attrition soared. It&rsquo;s a far cry from its heydays a decade ago when its steady growth was a hallmark in the industry. TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies, and Wipro are India&rsquo;s top four IT (information technology) companies by market capitalisation.&nbsp;&ldquo;We want to be in the winner&#39;s circle by 2027,&rdquo; Ravi Kumar, chief executive officer of Cognizant, said during the company&rsquo;s annual investor meeting. &ldquo;Our definition of the winner&#39;s circle is to be a top-tier player,&rdquo; referring to the club of the largest and fastest-growing IT services firms.&nbsp;Cognizant, which has its largest employee base in India, reported revenue growth of 2 per cent in 2024 from the year before. In constant currency, which negates the effect of currency volatility, it was 1.9 per cent. The company, which follows a calendar year, said in February growth included about 200 basis point, or 2 per cent, benefits of acquiring Belcan and Thirdera last year. Excluding those companies, organic growth numbers are flat or negative for the second consecutive year, posing a challenge for Kumar.&nbsp;Kumar, who joined Cognizant in 2023 after working at Infosys, said the company was positioned 10th in 2022 with revenue growth trailing peers by an average 8 per cent. It narrowed to 3 per cent during his first year and came at par with the industry in 2024.&nbsp;Cognizant is working on three plans to regain industry leadership: Improve talent by skilling employees, focus on platform-led growth in an AI-era, and gaining a lead over competitors in generative artificial intelligence. The company is banking on higher productivity as more codes are written by machines, industrialising AI and banking on AI agents.&nbsp;About 230,000 Cognizant employees have been trained in AI and 12,000 &ldquo;released&rdquo; due to the technology and automation, according to a presentation made by the company.&nbsp;Chief Financial Officer Jatin Dalal said the company is hopeful of improving margins. &ldquo;For outer years (apart from FY25), we believe we can deliver another 10 to 30 basis points of margin expansions,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Cognizant&rsquo;s adjusted operating margin, which has been subdued for some years, is a concern for investors. It was 15.3 per cent in 2024 and is expected to inch up to 15.5-15.7 per cent for 2025. While investors will cheer that improvement because it is the best guidance in the last five years, the numbers are still below the pre-pandemic levels of 18 per cent.&nbsp;The company&rsquo;s 2024 operating margins across businesses, barring financial services, &ldquo;were negatively impacted by increased compensation costs, partially offset by savings generated from our NextGen program and the beneficial impact of foreign currency,&rdquo; according the annual report.",

    "body": "Shares of highly shorted Hertz and Avis Budget Group surged on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s plan to slap a 25 per cent tariff on imported vehicles raised prospects of consumers opting for car rentals instead of buying expensive new cars.&nbsp;The new levies could add thousands of dollars to the cost of an average vehicle in the United States. The American Automotive Policy Council said it is &quot;critical&quot; that the tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids price hikes for consumers.&nbsp;&quot;These rental companies actually benefit from the tariffs because if car prices are going to go up, maybe some people who are like, &#39;You know what? I don&#39;t travel that much. I&#39;ll just rent a car&#39;,&quot; said Dennis Dick, chief strategist at the Stock Trader Network.Hertz jumped 23.8 per cent and Avis Budget gained 23 per cent after both firms lost nearly half of their value in the past year.&nbsp;Both Avis and Hertz are popular among short sellers, investors that bet on a stock&#39;s decline, with 13 per cent and 14.5 per cent of their respective outstanding shares in short positions, per LSEG data.&nbsp;&quot;You get a little bit of a short squeeze here too and that&#39;s really, really kick starting this rally,&quot; Dick said.&nbsp;J.P. Morgan analysts said some auto parts and services firms could benefit from the new tariff announcements as consumers are likely to hold on to cars longer than usual, with repair frequency, and size, both benefiting the sector.&nbsp;Shares of auto parts retailers O&#39;Reilly Automotive Inc and AutoZone gained about 2.5 per cent each, and Advance Auto Parts rose 5.4 per cent.&nbsp;Meanwhile, car firms with a global supply chain slumped, including General Motors, which was down 8 per cent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)&nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "body": "Bharti Airtel on Monday announced landing in Mumbai a subsea cable that will connect India to Africa and Europe via West Asia. It is part of the 2Africa system, which will be the world&#39;s longest subsea cable system when completed, spanning over 45,000 km.&nbsp;The 2Africa Pearls that Airtel announced is India&rsquo;s 20th undersea cable and it will have a data transfer rate of 100 terabits per second (Tbps). Airtel has partnered with Meta, the social media giant, and center3, a subsidiary of the Saudi Telecommunications Company, for laying the cable.&nbsp;A month ago Airtel had announced the landing of the 21,700 km-long SEA-ME-WE 6 (Southeast Asia-Middle East-West Europe-6, or SMW6) optical fibre communications cable in Chennai. It connects India to Singapore and Marseilles in France and has 220 Tbps of global capacity.&nbsp;2Africa Pearls is expected to help businesses to &ldquo;seamlessly access&rdquo; international connectivity and data centre services, said Airtel. Earlier cables have been integrated with the company&rsquo;s data centre arm, Nxtra by Airtel, at its facilities.&nbsp;The company said it is &ldquo;aggressively diversifying&rdquo; its global cable network of 400,000 Rkms (route km) in 50 countries and five continents. &quot;We will continue investing in global cable systems and future-proof our network with an aim to deliver high uptime, reliability, and superior quality network to our customers,&rdquo; said Sharat Sinha, director & chief executive officer of Airtel Business.&nbsp;Undersea cables are the backbone of global telecommunications, carrying approximately 99 percent of internet traffic and supporting services such as commerce, finance, government operations, digital health, and education. As of 2024, there were more than 500 active cable systems that transmitted vast amounts of data. While India is the largest data-generating nation and hosts more than 152 data centres, it was fed by mere 18 undersea cables till last year.&nbsp;The telecom industry faces hurdles in repairing cables as damages from fishing vessels are increasing, said Bharti Airtel&#39;s Chief Regulatory Officer Rahul Vatts earlier this week. &quot;The approval needed to get a repair ship to India takes six months. It requires officials from the Department of Telecommunications to be present on the ship when maintenance is going on,&quot; he said.&nbsp;The industry has to report if cable repairs are within or outside India&#39;s Economic Zone &ndash; a task that creates confusion and escalates costs, he said. He suggested that the government reduce the license fees for cable landing systems and give tax incentives on imports.&nbsp;Airtel has investments in 34 cables globally with some of the recent ones including Southeast Asia-Japan Cable 2 and Equiano. Its network investments include large cable systems like i2i Cable Network, Europe India Gateway, IMEWE, SEA-ME-WE-4, AAG, Unity, EASSy, Gulf Bridge International, and Middle East North Africa Submarine Cable.&nbsp;",

It has so far arrested eight accused in the case, including the bank&#39;s former general manager and head of accounts Hitesh Mehta, who was held on February 15. The agency has examined the data of the bank&#39;sA loans from 2010 onwards.&nbsp;&quot;During the investigation, it was found that actor Preity Zinta had taken a loan from the bank. She was sanctioned a loan of Rs 18 crore on January 7, 2011,&quot; he said. &quot;She had mortgaged her properties to the bank, which included a flat in Mumbai and a property in Shimla, collectively worth Rs 27.41 crore. In November 2012, she had to repay Rs 11.40 crore to the bank,&quot; the official said. On March 31, 2013, her loan account was classified asA due to non-repayment of it in time, and theA amount was Rs 11.47 crore, he said.&quot;The bank then offered settlement of the loan by giving a remission of Rs 1.55 crore on the final settlement of the loan to her. The remaining loan amount was paid by the actor on April 5, 2014,&quot; the official said. Meanwhile, the EOW will conduct a brain mapping test on Hitesh Mehta, the prime accused in the case, on Friday at the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in Mumbai&#39;s Kalina to collect more information about the money trail and involvement of other accused persons. The police had earlier conducted a polygraph test on Mehta, the official said. Former chairman of the bank Hiren Bhanu and his wife Gauri Bhanu are wanted accused in the case.",

This comes on the back of demand momentum remaining upbeat despite concerns of a consumption slowdown.&nbsp;Jubilant, which also operates Dunkin Donuts and Popeyes, has 2,000 Domino&rsquo;s outlets at present.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The government has taken a lot of efforts to boost consumption. Apart from the tax breaks announced in the Budget, interest rates have softened. A new pay commission is also expected to come in next year. These will all help drive consumption,&rdquo; said Sameer Khetarpal, chief executive officer and managing director, Jubilant FoodWorks.&nbsp;The company has started seeing tailwinds in both deliveries and dine-in, with like-for-like (LFL) sales growing 12.5 per cent year-on-year, driven by delivery LFL growth of 24.7 per cent in the third quarter of FY25.&nbsp;While inflation remains a concern, Jubilant FoodWorks has no plans to hike prices in the near future.&nbsp;&ldquo;At the moment, we have not taken any price hikes and have given back to the consumer by introducing free deliveries. We are not thinking of price hikes and are focused on driving growth in the business and acquiring new customers,&rdquo; Khetarpal said.&nbsp;The Indian food services market, he said, is valued at $60 billion, of which pizza makes up only $1 billion. This gives the brand a significant headroom for growth.&nbsp;&ldquo;When sentiments improve, hopefully we will see faster growth, majority of which will flow into our store economics,&rdquo; Khetarpal added.&nbsp;To help drive efficiencies, the company on Thursday, launched a new android-based point-of-sale (POS) system &lsquo;Elate&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This technology helps us get faster into newer cities and towns, allows supervisors to manage stores better, provide real-time help to the store manager and the team, while also auditing and ensuring governance and compliance in terms of food safety and other legal compliances,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;While Domino&#39;s continues to be the company&#39;s largest revenue generator, Jubilant is also attempting to break into the fried chicken market with its Popeyes brand, competing with market leader KFC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We plan to remain focused on growing this and scaling it up to 100 stores in the coming three years from 60 stores currently. Popeyes will be focused on the metro cities,&quot; Khetarpal said. However, this growth for the brand will be on a smaller base, as Popeyes is a relatively new entrant, having launched in 2022.&nbsp;In the December quarter, the company&rsquo;s revenue increased 56 per cent to ₹2,150.7 crore from ₹1,378 crore in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, its net profit dropped 34.2 per cent to ₹43.2 crore from ₹65.7 crore in the same period.",

    "title": "AM/NS India commissions first scrap unit, plans three more by FY26",
    "body": "ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India) has commissioned its first scrap processing facility, and is looking to set up at least three more by the financial year 2025-26 (FY26). The firm is setting up the unit to meet the growing demand for high-quality scrap for its steel production and to strengthen the domestic supply chain.&nbsp;The company&rsquo;s first scrap facility at Khopoli in Maharashtra, having a capacity of 120 kilo tonnes per annum (Ktpa), is already up and running.&nbsp;Akshaya Gujral, executive director of downstream operations at AM/NS India, said, &ldquo;By the end of FY26, we should have four functional scrap yards. This should give us approximately 0.5 mt of scrap which we can process and consume directly in our processes.&rdquo;&nbsp;By processing scrap at its own facilities, AM/NS India hopes to enhance material quality and yield while reducing conversion and logistics costs, and formalising the scrap industry. The investment in the facilities is expected to be about ₹350 crore.&nbsp;Gujral said that estimates suggest India would be a scrap-short nation. &ldquo;The scrap demand is expected to be around 50 million tonnes (mt) by 2030-2035 and scrap generation is expected to be about 40 mt.&rdquo; In 2024, scrap demand in India was 39 mt.&nbsp;So, India would have to rely on imports. &ldquo;Import of scrap will also diminish. The sources will dry up as the entire world understands the benefits of scrap and wants to consume more of the scrap that they generate within their countries,&rdquo; said Gujral.&nbsp;India imported 8 mt of scrap in 2024. Major countries exporting scrap to India are the US, UK, Brazil, Australia, Poland, Malaysia, Bahrain, among others.&nbsp;According to market analysts, about 14-15 per cent of India&rsquo;s scrap requirements are sourced from the US. As US steel mills step up production in the wake of tariffs, scrap exports may get impacted.&nbsp;AM/NS India noted that India&rsquo;s scrap supply chain is highly fragmented, with materials passing through multiple intermediaries &ndash; from local scrap collectors to scrap yards &ndash; before reaching the consumption points. This inflates costs, diminishes material quality and adds little value across the chain, according to the company.&nbsp;To achieve its goal of 10 per cent scrap utilisation by 2030, AM/NS understands that it cannot depend on a fragmented supply chain and is therefore setting up the processing facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;About 65 per cent of AM/NS India&rsquo;s existing steelmaking capacity is gas-based direct-reduced iron (DRI) &ndash; electric arc furnace (EAF), a process suited for using scrap. Apart from captive use, some of the scrap may also be sold in the external market.",

    "title": "NCLT orders status quo on shareholding of Aakash Educational Services",
    "body": "The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Bengaluru, on Thursday ordered status quo on the shareholding of Aakash Educational Services Ltd.&nbsp;This was on a plea by the resolution professional of the parent company of Byju&rsquo;s, Think and Learn Pvt Ltd.&nbsp;The case will now be heard on April 30.&nbsp;Background&nbsp;The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had last year in December sent this matter to the NCLT after Aakash Educational Services told the appellate tribunal that its move to amend the Articles of Association (AoA) was aimed at infusing funds by selling equity and saving the firm from going &ldquo;down the path&rdquo; of Byju&rsquo;s &mdash; a debt-ridden edtech firm that owns Aakash.&nbsp;But the NCLAT did not set aside the NCLT order halting Aakash from amending its AoA and sent the matter back to the NCLT.&nbsp;The appellate tribunal had, however, allowed Aakash to move an application before the NCLT for relief and told the NCLT to decide the matter within three weeks from the date of filing of the application.&nbsp;Aakash&rsquo;s counsel argued before the appellate tribunal that it was vital for their survival and future growth to amend the AoA.&nbsp;Articles of Association outline the rules and regulations that govern a firm&rsquo;s operations and define its purpose.&nbsp;The proposed amendments allegedly sought to dilute the rights of minority shareholders, including Singapore VII Topco I Pte Ltd, owned by Blackstone, which holds a 6.97 per cent stake in Aakash. Blackstone had alleged that its rights and interests were being violated.&nbsp;The dispute revolves around proposed amendments to Aakash&rsquo;s AoA. This was reportedly first raised during an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). Minority shareholders, including Blackstone, filed a mismanagement and oppression petition with the NCLT. They claimed the amendments violated their rights under a prior merger framework agreement (MFA).&nbsp;On November 25, 2024, the Karnataka High Court stayed an NCLT order that barred Aakash from passing a resolution to amend its AoA.&nbsp;The resolution was an attempt to reduce the influence of minority shareholders, the investors had argued. They reportedly accused Byju&rsquo;s, which has a stake in Aakash, of trying to give a greater say to big investors like Manipal Education.&nbsp;Aakash had challenged the NCLT order in the Karnataka High Court, arguing that the tribunal had failed to provide sufficient reasons for halting the resolution. The High Court granted an interim stay on the NCLT order. However, it clarified that this stay should not be interpreted as a final opinion on the matter.&nbsp;The Supreme Court, on November 29 last year, barred Aakash from implementing a resolution to amend its AoA passed at its EGM. It had sent the matter to the NCLAT to be decided.&nbsp;In 2021, Byju&rsquo;s (Think and Learn) acquired 35-year-old brick-and-mortar coaching centre Aakash for nearly $1 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. However, Byju&rsquo;s, which was valued at $22 billion in 2022, has seen its fortunes dwindle. This is due to various regulatory issues and disputes with investors, triggering the firm&rsquo;s insolvency.",

    "title": "Meesho's logistics arm Valmo handles 50% of orders, doubling from last year",
    "body": "More than half of IPO-bound e-commerce platform Meesho&rsquo;s orders are now being fulfilled via its in-house logistics platform Valmo, up from around 22 per cent a year ago, the company said in its annual report for 2023-24.&nbsp;In just one year, the company&rsquo;s logistics arm has expanded to approximately 15,000 pin codes, supported by 6,000 logistics partners and creating 85,000 jobs as of December 2024.&nbsp;&ldquo;Valmo has significantly enhanced efficiency while fostering local entrepreneurship, creating thousands of jobs, and driving sustainable growth in the logistics sector,&rdquo; said the company in the report. &ldquo;Valmo is transforming India&rsquo;s e-commerce logistics ecosystem by building a seamless, efficient, and cost-effective network that empowers local entrepreneurs.&rdquo;&nbsp;As of December 2024, Meesho had about 187 million unique annual transacting users (ATUs), meaning 13 per cent of India has made a purchase through the platform. Total orders placed grew to about 1.3 billion between April and December 2024, reflecting the increasing frequency and diversity of purchases, with more people turning to Meesho for a wide range of their daily needs. This trend has driven impressive growth across categories like home and kitchen, beauty and personal care, and kids and baby care. As a result, Meesho continued to be India&rsquo;s most downloaded shopping app for four consecutive years, underscoring the platform&rsquo;s growing appeal and reach.&nbsp;With zero per cent commission, intuitive tools, and smart discovery features, Meesho said it makes online selling simple&mdash;even for first-time digital entrepreneurs. Today, the company said over 400,000 annual transacting sellers, from large manufacturers to small businesses, thrive on the platform&mdash;unlocking scale, affordability, and opportunity.&nbsp;During FY24, Meesho reported a 33 per cent jump in operating revenue to Rs 7,615 crore.&nbsp;It became the first horizontal Indian e-commerce company to achieve profitability in FY24 and the first to generate positive free cash flow of Rs 197 crore for the full year. This success was fuelled by efficiencies across multiple areas, including logistics, as well as the strategic use of generative AI and machine learning to enhance product discovery, improve the in-app experience, and provide round-the-clock customer support. Meesho&rsquo;s selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of revenue declined significantly, supported by strong consumer awareness, organic traction, and the inherent operating leverage of a marketplace e-commerce model. As a result, adjusted losses narrowed by 97 per cent from Rs 1,569 crore to just Rs 53 crore, excluding employee share-based compensation expense.&nbsp;Artificial intelligence&nbsp;AI powers Meesho&rsquo;s seamless, intuitive, and inclusive shopping experiences, driving real-time personalisation through a robust ranking system that curates unique experiences for users. Large language models (LLMs) enhance search by decoding vernacular expressions, correcting errors, and refining queries for precise results. GenAI-driven customer support, available in six Indian languages, resolves about 90 per cent of queries at one-fifth the cost while improving customer effort score (CES) and customer satisfaction (CSAT). On the logistics front, the GeoIndia model converts unstructured addresses into precise geolocations, outperforming industry benchmarks in rural regions. To maintain platform integrity, Meesho&rsquo;s AI-first fraud detection system, powered by generative AI and advanced architectures like graph neural networks, ensures stringent quality checks, predicts return to origin (RTO), and detects fraud in real time.&nbsp;",

As AI becomes central to upskilling, a growing number of learners &mdash; from seasoned professionals to school students &mdash; are eager to explore and experiment with technology.&nbsp;BrightCHAMPS, an edtech firm that delivers learning courses to students in the K-12 segment, found that 58 per cent of students globally are already integrating AI into their studies. In comparison, 36 per cent of them use the technology for their homework.&nbsp;Ravi Bhushan, founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of BrightCHAMPS told Business Standard that AI is one of the courses most in demand in the market.&nbsp;&ldquo;We exclusively launched a Gen AI course for kids. In the US, every fourth student is inquiring and enrolling in AI courses. India is not very far behind compared to the US. In fact, Indian parents are more curious than US parents,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The Gen AI course is among the seven flagship courses the company offers and though launched only eight-months back, it currently features among the top three best-selling courses.&nbsp;Edtech unicorn Emeritus has introduced over 20 courses focused on machine learning and AI. At Emeritus, three of the top five online certificates are AI courses.&nbsp;Bhushan Heda, chief operating officer, Emeritus, said, &ldquo;We saw a surge of almost three- times in enrolments for AI courses in 2024 compared to 2023, with 75 per cent of our enrolments coming from professionals with more than 10 years of experience, primarily in IT, engineering, and consulting.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to the 2025 Global Workplace Skills Study, India is leading the way in AI adoption as 96 per cent of the professionals said they want to be AI-ready and upskill themselves.&nbsp;Krishna Kumar, founder and CEO of Simplilearn shares that 30-40 per cent of the firm&rsquo;s revenue comes from its AI offerings globally.&nbsp;Kumar also highlights that it&rsquo;s not just the engineers who are taking these courses, managers and leaders are too reskilling themselves.&nbsp;&ldquo;One segment is the technical community who wants to learn AI so that they are not left behind. Another segment is managers and leaders who want to understand how they can leverage AI in businesses,&rdquo; Kumar said.&nbsp;He added that if he were to rank the top five courses on Simplilearn, it would be all in AI only.&nbsp;Imarticus Learning, another edtech firm offering professional courses, said up to 20 per cent of the company&#39;s offerings are in emerging technologies, including AI. One particular Gen AI course, directed to executives and learners, which is about the application of AI, is among the top five courses at the company, said Nikhil Barshikar, founder and managing director of the platform.&nbsp;While AI courses are being latched on by aspirants, edtech platforms are also using AI to make sure their content is available for a large number of aspirants.&nbsp;PhysicsWallah (PW) is using AI to bridge the language barrier for students. Under its Project Bharat, the course content will be scripted in regional languages, dubbed, and then enhanced with AI. According to the company, the approach aims to replicate the experience of lectures delivered in-person by the faculty.&nbsp;PW also announced AI-driven tools such as Prep Meter and PW Books to enhance student learning. While Prep Meter is an advanced performance tracking system that provides personalised video recommendations for improvement, PW Books is a smart digital NCERT book available as a standalone app on the Play Store.",

    "body": "Everhope Oncology, a joint venture between Narayana Health and a venture capital firm, has secured $10 million in seed funding to establish medical and surgical cancer care facilities in Delhi and Mumbai, with plans to expand to 10 cities over the next three years.&nbsp;This is the largest healthcare seed round in the last 24 months. These medical and surgical cancer care facilities will provide diagnosis, treatment, and supportive care for cancer patients, including chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and palliative care.&nbsp;&quot;The rapid rise in cancer incidence is a growing health crisis in India. Today, an estimated 8 million Indians live with cancer, and projections suggest that one in nine will develop the disease in their lifetime,&quot; the company said. However, India&#39;s healthcare infrastructure is struggling to keep pace with this rising burden. Over the next few years, an estimated 40,000 additional chemotherapy and surgical beds will be required.&nbsp;Oncologists in India are overburdened, with just one oncologist for every 2,000 cancer patients&mdash;compared to one per 100 in the US. This results in limited time per patient, increased anxiety for patients, and burnout among doctors. In addition to poor access and prohibitively expensive diagnostics and treatments, the stigma surrounding cancer has led to over 60 per cent of cases being detected late, contributing to higher patient mortality.&nbsp;Everhope Oncology seeks to address these challenges by establishing dedicated chemotherapy facilities and specialised surgical centres. These centres will offer a modern, comfortable, and infection-free environment, ensuring personalised attention, minimal wait times, and an enhanced patient experience. A clinical board comprising experienced oncologists, in close collaboration with Narayana Health, will implement globally validated protocols to ensure best-in-class clinical outcomes. Additionally, Everhope will provide holistic care services, including mental health counselling, nutritional consultations, and pain management. A 24/7 care concierge service will support patients between treatment sessions, providing guidance and assistance during this critical phase of their journey.&nbsp;Viren Shetty, vice-chairman of Narayana Health, said, &quot;Most people visualise cancer treatment as thin and frail people stuck with hundreds of tubes, walking from one crowded hospital room to another. This is why most of us avoid cancer screening and seek out non-scientific treatment options. We want to change the common misperceptions of curing cancer. Globally, most cancer therapies&mdash;chemotherapy, surgery, palliative care, radiation, consultations&mdash;are conducted in comfortable, dedicated spaces in retail locations far away from hospitals. With Everhope, we aim to provide patients with best-in-class onco-therapies in comfortable suites close to their homes, where they can get treated in a crowd-free environment and go about the rest of their day.&quot;&nbsp;Pankaj Jethwani, managing partner at W Health Ventures, said, &ldquo;As we work towards solving pressing healthcare issues, our collaboration with Narayana Health marks a significant step forward. Globally, cancer care has seen remarkable innovation&mdash;from daycare chemotherapy infusion centres to advanced diagnostics for early detection and breakthrough therapies like CAR-T. With Everhope, we aim to drive oncology innovation in India, working alongside entrepreneurial oncologists across the country who are eager to become business owners.&rdquo;&nbsp;In recent years, cancer care has emerged as one of the fastest-growing specialties within multi-speciality hospitals. At the same time, there is a significant opportunity for the expansion of dedicated cancer facilities. This growth is driven by rising patient volumes, the strong economic viability of single-speciality oncology centres, increasing entrepreneurial ambitions among oncologists, and greater patient awareness&mdash;enabling patients to seek the best treatment options upon diagnosis.&nbsp;",

Ltd. (TLPL), the parent company of Byju&rsquo;s, and BCCI, which had initiated an insolvency process over unpaid sponsorship dues of Rs 158 crore in July 2024.&nbsp;&ldquo;There was a settlement (with BCCI), that settlement was before the Committee of Creditors (CoC) was being constituted,&rdquo; said Arun Kathpalia, the senior advocate appearing for Raveendran.&nbsp;According to the appeal, Byju&rsquo;s promoters had settled with BCCI in August 2024, depositing the full settlement amount in escrow. However, US-lender GLAS Trust Company LLC, claiming to represent term-loan lenders owed approximately $1.2 billion, intervened to block the withdrawal, the promoters told the appellate tribunal.&nbsp;A key issue in the appeal is the procedurally improper formation of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) under GLAS&rsquo;s influence. The appeal claims that instead of forwarding BCCI&rsquo;s withdrawal application to the NCLT within the required three days, the IRP was pressured to delay the filing and hastily constitute a CoC that included GLAS as a financial creditor.&nbsp;A committee of creditors is a group of financial creditors or lenders who represent a company in the insolvency process.&nbsp;The appeal also raised concerns over the legitimacy of the CoC&rsquo;s composition.&nbsp;The NCLAT will continue hearing the case on Thursday.&nbsp;During the hearing on Monday, Riju Raveendran&rsquo;s attorney told the appellate tribunal that Raveendran had paid Rs 158 crore from his own funds to settle the dispute with BCCI and therefore the money should be kept outside the scrutiny of its committee of lenders.&nbsp;Riju, the younger brother of founder Byju Raveendran, had earlier told the appellate tribunal that the settlement with BCCI had been finalised before the CoC was formed.&nbsp;On February 10, the Bengaluru bench of the NCLT had directed BCCI to submit the Rs 158 crore settlement plea before the CoC. If accepted, Byju&rsquo;s could exit insolvency proceedings. However, lenders, which include US-based GLAS Trust and Aditya Birla Finance, opposed this, saying the settlement with BCCI was &#39;tainted&#39; money.",

The fund also aims to collaborate with the government to address nationwide issues.&nbsp;Nirupa Shankar, joint managing director, Brigade Group, told Business Standard that eventually, the plan is to collaborate with the government to explore how these technologies can be implemented across cities in India to tackle broader urban challenges like water and solar management.&nbsp;&quot;The Earth Fund aims to invest in technology nationwide&mdash;Tier I or Tier II.

    "body": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is considering a key relaxation on the issuance of employee stock ownership plans (Esops) to founders of startups planning to go public.&nbsp;According to a consultation paper released on Thursday, Sebi may allow founders, identified as promoters or part of the promoter group, to hold or exercise Esop benefits granted one year before the company&rsquo;s initial public offering (IPO) plan.&nbsp;Currently, Esops are reserved for employees, and the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014, prohibit their issuance to promoters. However, startups are eligible for certain relaxations.&nbsp;The existing norms are unclear on whether employees holding Esops who later become promoters can exercise these options. To address this ambiguity, Sebi&rsquo;s consultation paper proposes changes to the regulations.&nbsp;&ldquo;The classification of a founder as a promoter arises from the practice of considering shareholding, including options that are either vested or granted. These options and other benefits are part of the employee&rsquo;s remuneration. Thus, the view that an employee who is later categorised as a promoter due to their shareholding, including options and benefits, would have to forgo these benefits may not be justifiable,&rdquo; Sebi said in the consultation paper.&nbsp;However, the regulator underscored the need for a cooling-off period between option grants and the IPO to prevent misuse.&nbsp;&quot;In order to align the interest of the founders, who otherwise hold significantly diluted stake in their own companies, with the performance of the company, ESOPs form a great incentive tool. By allowing such founders to continue holding ESOPs even post reclassification as promoter, provides policy outcome certainty,&quot; Vishal Yaduvanshi, Partner (Regional Co-Head - Capital Markets - North), Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.&nbsp;The proposed relaxation is at a time when the regulator has been asking new age companies planning IPOs to identify promoters, specifically those with significant holdings in the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebi noted that regulations do not prohibit the conversion of such options once an individual ceases to be an employee.&nbsp;The regulator observed that founders of various new-age technology firms often receive Esops or equity-linked instruments instead of cash benefits in the early years to align their interests with those of other shareholders.&nbsp;The consultation paper also proposed changes to clarify norms on the minimum holding period for equity shares eligible for an offer for sale in public issues. Sebi recommends including equity shares received upon the conversion of fully paid-up compulsorily convertible securities, extending the minimum holding period of one year to these securities.&nbsp;Considering Relaxation&nbsp;*&nbsp; The proposed change would allow founders to exercise ESOPs granted one year prior to the IPO&nbsp;*&nbsp; Current rules restrict ESOP issuance to promoters, creating ambiguity for founders who were initially employees&nbsp;*&nbsp; Sebi&#39;s consultation paper aims to clarify if founders can retain ESOPs earned as employees&nbsp;&nbsp;",
